    "A common good practice is too control your program through command line arguments, by doing this you make changes to your script without having to make any code changes.  To control arguments in python we use the argparse module and create an ArgumentParser object.  Arguments come in two different types, positional and optional.  Positional arguments are mandatory, must be specified in order, and can be identified by not having a '-' in front of it (the stuff argument below).  Optional arguments can be in any order, are optional, and can be identified by having a '-' in front of it.  After setting the options for your arguments you can just call parse_args which will return all of your options.  The name of the attribute will be the name of the flag unless you specify the 'dest' option.  It is also typical to log these to a file to have the run history of an application."

There are currently over 70K packages available.  Typing the following at the command line would install and configure everything for you, some IDEs also have this functionality built right into it.

Imagine you are working on two projects and each requires the BeautifulSoup library, however one project needs 1.5 and the other needs 2.1, python is unable to determine to tell a difference between library versions.  To solve this problem we create virtual environments, these are isolated python folders where you can install separate libraries.  In your IDE you can then select which python interpreter you want to use for the project.  You need the virtualenv package installed to do this, then navigate to the folder you want create en environment in and type the following\n",

When you are done type deactivate to disable installing to the virtual environment.  Once this is finished you can select this new environment in your IDE to use that specific version of python and libraries.  A common next step is to save a list of the packages installed, this way it is easy to rebuild the environment.  The requirements file can be supplied to pip to install everything in it.\n",

Cold beer, good friends, warm sun and boys playing volleyball in the back court (although it troubles me to see so many of them playing barefoot in what amounts to an oversized ashtray. PLEASE keep your shoes on, boys! It reminds me of playing volleyball in an enormous cat litter box.)

Charlie's is NOT for the gays who like to put on their tightest T-shirt, gel their hair up and pretend like they just saw someone they know so they can do anything but make eye contact with another human being. 

It IS for the gays that are comfortable with themselves and enjoy talking to other gays that sometimes are cowboys, sometimes are drag queens, but are almost ALWAYS friendly (even if they're a bit tanked). 

The small pitchers on Sundays have kind of become a tradition. And it's fun to watch people two-step on the weekend nights. 

Downsides? Sometimes the crowd looks like the crowd at the rescue mission. The Arizona anti-smoking law somehow doesn't apply to the COVERED patio in the back, therefore making it uncomfortable to breathe back there. 

And, PLEASE take a cab if you've had too much to drink. Cops hang out waiting to nab ya later on at night. 

Overall, it's a fun, if somewhat tired, staple of the gay nightlife in Phoenix. Also have ""branches""  in Chicago, Denver and Las Vegas.

And, it's always a sure-fire hit with straight sisters, brothers, kids and moms (yes, I said moms) that are in from out of town.

We waited for ages in a queue. When we finally were able to access the refreshments and register area, I found no beverages really appropriate for small children - thick, exotic smoothies, or juice water for £2.70\/bottle. We took the latter, a bag of crisps and a single macchiato - all for a grand total of over £5. A bit on the steep side I would say. Especially given the fact that we queued for ages, were showered in broken glass when the customer behind us lost the battle with balancing her tray of food in one hand and all her winter garb in her other, and then we had to search for ages to find a table to sit at. We finally had to ask to join an already occupied table. We squeezed onto one chair - my child perched on my lap and my macchiato now lukewarm.

This place reminds me of one of the 'famous chef' restaurants in Vegas but I am willing to actually come here and pay for it, while other places that are similar in the pretentious vibe and I am not willing to go in. The staff here was really nice and on the ball, I always appreciate that in a place.

I came here with a big group so I was able to try a bunch of their dishes. All the food here was actually really good, a nice surprise, and even though it looks like not enough food on your plate for most dishes, it usual has ended up being just the perfect amount of food. I had the pork sliders which came in a portion of 3, with nothing else but it really was okay, I felt full after eating them.  A burger here will set you back about 16 bucks but it will be worth it. They are made from wagu beef, and one of the best burgers I have had in Vegas living there about 6 years now. It comes with fries too which were handcut and freshly made, a nice touch.The side portion of carrots were interesting to note. They looked like a bunch of freshly picked long stem carrots that were soaked in honey or something similar, but were good. The seafood dishes also looked impressive and no one was unhappy with their meal after we left. They do offer a dessert selection as well, but we were so full that we only tried two of them. Both were good choices-if you want to see pictures of multiple food items of any desserts check out my photos for this place.

I got the club sandwich and cole slaw to go for another meal, since there's a refridgerator in the room to keep it cold.

My waitress was exceptional.  She was extremely pleasant, polite, and courteous.  One of the very best I've had the pleasure of being served by.  I wish I'd remembered her name so I could give her credit.

My siblings vehicle was malfunctioning, which is the reason to take a car in. 
I informed the front desk agent there seems to be a problem with the radiator. Me not being a mechanic, I agreed for a full inspection of the vehicle.  Meanwhile the representative asked me to apply for a credit card and any inspection would be free if approved. 
I gladly applied, and was denied. Big deal. The big problem is that he tore the sheet with my personal information and placed it on his desk. I have no Idea if the information was thrown away or it it was shredded. Being that this location has a BBB sticker, it gave me somewhat; peace of mind. 
They ""found the issue"" claiming there was no leak anywhere..(as a professional business I trust they found the issue) and I agreed for them to replace some sensors.
Today the car is dead in the middle of the road while My Sibling is wondering if anything was actually done to the car. 
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, now I will have to wait to see if my personal information will be stolen.
Good Job TireWorks!

I am going back in today to see what will be done. Might change review as I am in the customer service business and company image is huge. 
Will be going to the BBB after today.

Today, after a long day at work I was driving in the area and I felt in need to have some comfort food and especially hot since today is very cold. So here I am again. 

Jade pho is still run by the same owner and the service is still handle by the same server who's demonstrated to handle the service in the same fast and efficient way. 
I had the old classic dish: house special which consist in rice noodles with beef, beef tendons, cartilages, meatballs, beef tripes all served in a delicious homemade beef broth.
The whole bowl comes as usual with the boost of cilantro, mint leafs and sprouts. 

The only downside I believe that the amount of side greens has been reduced. Not so sure why but as far as my memory can recall from my recent trip to Vietnam, the serving of herbs is usually very very generous because that's what Vietnamese love to death when they are having pho. 

Now, believe me when I say that I do understand that we are not in Vietnam here, but since before the portions of mint, cilantro and sprouts were more abundant than what I observed today, and knowing that the owner is Vietnamese, I was expecting the same quantity: no more no less. 

Overall Pho Jade is still a very good place for the quality they serve but this time I want to adjudicate only 3 stars just because I found the portion of the greens reduced.

I'm so disappointed because this place generally has good reviews. Take my word for it and go somewhere else if you want a gel mani.

I asked for a full set UV gel manicure. Instead, I got acrylic. When I asked the lady what she was doing, she said UV gel. I said no, it's acrylic because it set without going under the lamp. She told me the lamp was actually for bio-gel and cost $20 more. Her and the other ladies insisted that this powder was UV gel. I'm literally sitting there like ?????? 

UV gel is a GEL that cures under a UV LAMP. Acrylic POWDER cures with air. I've had gel manis done multiple times and I'm not stupid, so I suspected that they were trying to scam me. 

Anyway, I'm tired and embarrassed after like 3 ladies all insisted that this was gel and other ppl in the salon were looking at me. She puts down a UV gel top coat. And then normal polish. And then a regular top coat. I got charged $15 extra for 1 COAT OF UV BASE POLISH. It cost the same as buying a gel lamp and doing it myself. $45 for 1 layer of UV polish FFS IM SO MAD. I should have walked out.

Unfortunately, scams like this are pretty common - you can read about it here:

Also - although the lady took time to shape and buff my nails, she applied some crooked so my index finger is randomly sloping to the side. She also cut my cuticle and man it stung when she applied acetone to clean up the polish. 

In terms of cleanliness, there's nail powder everywhere. The nail drill she used oh me was caked in powder and she didn't clean it off. I also watched a woman put thinner into an old bottle of polish because it had dried up. I know some places do it but come on at least try to hide it from the customers.

Me and my mom decided to try it, after she'd heard some good things about it from coworkers. We were excited to stop in because after all, who doesn't love a good waffle?!

We decided to try sweet potato waffles and chicken; she had tenders, I had wings, which were quite smaller than what I expected ater the description I'd recieved, but weren't bad. Her tenders looked quite under cooked, but she said they were done, but could have been cooked a little more. The waffles looked and smelled amazing!! But unfortunately were not cooked all the way through when we cut into them.

Reluctantly (I hate to complain!!), I took the waffles back to the counter with the hopes that we could recieve waffles that were cooked entirely through. Unfortunately, we were told ""that's just how that waffle comes out"", and "" we make out batter using sweet potato puree, so it's not that it's undone, it's just really moist"" and ""our waffle makers are set to a timer"". I don't know about you, but those all sound like excuses to me!! I know an under cooked waffle when I see one, and those were it!

Instead of causing a big fuss, we opted for the cinnamon waffles instead of continuing to eat the half- cooked waffles were served first. When they came out they were not warm at all (the butter didn't melt!), and my mom recieved an original versus the cinnamon waffle she ordered. The cashier came to see how everything was, and when we let her know of the other issues, she simply had even more excuses! And the worst part is that the owner was in the dining room at the next table over from us during our entire visit and never even acknoweleged the problem!!

The restaurant is super small, so it'd be wise to make reservations beforehand. They also have another menu option - Edo menu ($35) - which you need to let them know the day before. The restaurant, while small, is cozy and quiet. Service is also very good- my cup was never empty. 
The plate of assorted appetizers was all very tasty. The soba noodle salad was delicious as well - the noodles were perfectly chewy and also flavourful. I loved the tuna tataki- the slice melted in my mouth and was super good. The mini okonamiyaki was very tasty as well. The main dish, salmon, was also very tasty. I particularly liked the soupy rice dish- it was much more flavourful than I expected, and having a warm bowl of soup on a cold day felt very cozy. The ginger ice cream was also very good, and the ginger flavour wasn't overpowering. Overall, their courses were all very delicious.

Bottom line: cocktail quality is 6 out of 5 stars. Absolutely unbelievable drinks here.

On the other hand, ambiance, service, noise level, and so on are fairly typical for a not-so-great bar on the Strip in Las Vegas and I'd give it 2.5 stars.

Personally, this is one of my favorite bars, because all I really care about is getting a great drink. However, I know a lot of people focus on other things, so that's my take. Now that that's out of the way, let me tell you why this bar is amazing.

I took my friend to this place a few weeks ago, since it's a 10-minute walk from my condo nearby, and we just wanted to have a drink anywhere really. When we sat down, I noticed that all the bartenders were in standard uniform, but one man was in a two-piece suit with a lovely tie, and his garb seemed managerial. With a huge stroke of fortune for me, he took our order: an Old Fashioned for me, and ""something with Amaretto"" for my indecisive companion.

He decided to take significant creative liberties with my order, which I turned out to be eternally grateful for, and he concocted a libation of beautiful complexity for hers. I have memorized the recipe for the new spin on an ""Old Fashioned"" that was served to me:

2oz. Glenmorangie 12
1oz. Sloe gin
1oz. Lillet Rouge
Orange bitters
Lemon twist

Shaken and served up with a homemade pickled cherry. They make their own cherries. If you're not smiling right now, we're not friends.

This drink, as a whiskey fan, is ABSOLUTELY divine and quite literally has changed my life forever. I don't think I'll ever go out drinking to a reasonably well-stocked bar and forego asking for this cocktail for as long as I shall live. It doesn't yet have a name, but you must try it if you love whiskey. You can substitute whatever whiskey you want in place of the Glenmorangie, and all of them will impart their own unique twists. You'll have a very hard time finding Lillet Rouge in many places, so try substituting any cherry or berry liqueur in place of it, such as Cherry Herring. It makes for another great drink.

The ""something with Amaretto"" turned out to be a beautifully complex recipe including a ginger liqueur, cayenne pepper, and a bay leaf. The flavor of this drink changed multiple times throughout a sip, and showcased all of its components individually.

A sizable lady with an accent took our order and acted like every customer was an inconvenience to her with how sharply she spoke. I witnessed three other orders before mine and she made Gordon Ramsay look demure. 

They don't have a kids menu posted that I could see and being that it was our first time here I asked if they had kid sized burgers. She replied ""yes we do. It is a burger, fries and small drink""

I said ""I'd like two of those meals with lettuce and ketchup on the burgers.""

Her curt reply ""The meals are plain and only come with the bun and meat""

So my obvious question ""do you carry ketchup?"" Which she said ""yes""

My next obvious question ""I can't have ketchup and lettuce put on them?"" She just peered at me over her glasses and said my order total. I had no idea if that meant I would have the burgers prepared how I asked. I ordered a regular size burger for myself too.

(Oh and in the middle of ordering our food, the she turned and started talking to one of the cooks behind her and commenting about what a customer on the patio was doing)

Ironic now that I think about it. They have a sign posted by their register that basically says ""we can refuse service to anyone"". Speaks volumes as to how their view their customer base. 

Surprisingly the burgers arrived with lettuce and ketchup. 

The only positives: basic thick cut fries were hot and arrived with the appropriate toppings. 

I'm sorry but not everyone on earth enjoys burnt hockey pucks for patties. And it took me three bites of bun to actually hit meat. I have a feeling I was also served a kid size burger on a regular bun. At least I HOPE their buns aren't meant to eclipse the meat. 

They must have killer breakfast or something because I don't know how they stay open with how rude they are and with such badly prepared the burgers.

I've visited them three times now and each time is amazing. They have an amazing menu of healthy items suited for any diet from Atkins to HCG. G&P has it covered.

On my first visit I ate their Crab and Avocado lettuce cups. It was very tasty and healthy. The lettuce cups came loaded with real crab! Definitely worth the $9.99 price tag. I also had their Wellness Drink! Let me tell you I am totally in love with their Wellness Drink (minus the pineapple cause i'm allergic). It only has 286 calories and  tastes amazing. I love the green grapes and the fact that they use agave nectar is perfect for my diabetes!!! 

On my next couple visits I ordered the Wellness Drink of course, but I brought my husband so I could try his drinks too! He tried the Apple Pie Smoothie. It totally tasted like apple pie! The one he got the other day though is almost as good as the Wellness drink ,but it's called the Tofu Banana Split! YUMMY! You can't taste the squash or any veggies that are in it. I recommend this one for your pickie eaters!

I didn't get a chance to sit in the dining room, but the bar area itself was pretty nice with plenty of seating and a better than average tequila selection.  They also had plenty of draft beer options . The area itself has high ceilings,nice lighting, beautiful ceiling fans, really dark wood, a couple of plasmas and plenty of leather.  The wine selection is decent and has plenty of options by the glass.  We ordered a few of the ""small plates"" while we sat at the bar.  However, you have the option to order off of the full menu, small plates menu, and bar menu.  I think it's a bit silly to have three different menus for your options while you sit at the bar.  It seems that if you can order anything off of any menu then their is no need for three different menus.  Anyways, we started with the beef carpaccio, which was a bit above average served with parmigiano-reggiano, olive oil and roasted peppers.  The flavors melded pretty well together and the roasted peppers were nice albeit a bit oversoaked in olive oil.  The tuna tartare was okay.  I guess the tuna was of decent quality, but it was served a bit above room temperature which is a mistake. I think tartare should be served room temperature or a bit below.  I really liked the cured meats selection, which was served with a nice selection of olives and three different meats.  The prosciutto (sp?) was delicious and served room temperature which is correct.  We also had a few slices of a delicious salami and sopressata.  This is a good option for under $7.  In fact overall I found the prices to be quite reasonable.  Finally, we ended with a trio of delicious lamb burgers.  This was my favorite from last night.  It was three perfectly cooked medium flavorful lamb burgers served with perfectly caramalized onions on warm, buttery soft bread with a sheeps milk blue cheese.  I really appreciated this cheese because it was a milder blue cheese and did not overpower the meat.  We stopped in the cigar bar after dinner and I was quite pleased with the space.

Other children notified a lifeguard that was approximately 20-25 feet from them and his response was ""I can't move"".  Children with the child managed to pull the child out of the water and notified adults who then literally jumped in the pool as the lifeguard sat at his post unconcerned!   

Witnessing this intense ordeal the lifeguard still made no attempt to get assistance until he was instructed to do so by an angry adult submerged in pool water fully clothed.  

Others in the group went to get assistance from upper level management and were left waiting for over 20 minutes and when the ""Director of Hotel Services""  Shelly Essex took time to address the issue she down played this critical situation and stated that ""it was not her lifeguards responsibility to babysit kids in the pool area"". Her demeanor was of no true concern to the incident and frankly she was unprofessional, rude, dismissive and abrasive.   

According to Wikipedia A lifeguard supervises the safety and rescue of swimmers, surfers, and other water sports participants such as in a swimming pool, water park, or beach. Lifeguards are strong swimmers and trained in first aid, certified in water rescue using a variety of aids and equipment depending on requirements of their particular venue. In some areas, lifeguards are part of the emergency services system to incidents and in some communities, the lifeguard service also carries out mountain rescues, or may function as the primary EMS provider.

I sat in the pool area supervising my daughter for over two hours and I observed South Points lifeguards engaged in conversation with one another as well as clean up the bar area but when it came to providing the services they were trained to do they did nothing......

Came in here again on an emergency mission - looking for a cable to make my DVD Burner work so I could burn the memorial video for my cousins funeral.  So I may have been a little frazzled.

I walked in and stopped dead, not sure where to look.  They have all this crap up front now, it looks more like a toy store than a Radio Shack.  In fact, now that I think of it, I don't think there was a single radio in site.

I stand there , look around blankly and blink for a few minutes, when the employee notices another living, breathing person in the store.

I explained what I needed, and he didn't even try to look or help. Just told me they don't have those cables. Buh-Bye.  Didn't even offer a suggestion on where else to go, ask what I needed them for, nope, just a ""Don't let the door hit you on the way out"" attitude.

We had the regular ginseng chicken soup ($15.93) and the grilled short rib patty ($9.99). The ginseng chicken is stuffed with sticky rice and the soup comes with some noodles so there was no need to add any rice. The grilled short rib patty also had two half-sliced thick rice cake. 

We found the short rib patty very tasty - it's not too oily because its made with minced meat mixed with korean dates, pinenuts and chestnuts which gave it a nice chewy texture, plus a nice aroma to it. They'd pour the bbq sauce on the patty at the table for you, and the staff even put her hand over the hot plate to make sure nothing gets sprayed onto me.

I arrived early, 6am pickup, and there was no line, so that was great, and we were helped immediately, but then, just like all the reviews, our car was changed.  We selected a group which included either the BMW 428i or Audi A5, but the associate handed me the keys to an Audi A3, which was less expensive, without acknowledging it.  I think he just expected me to take it and leave.  I asked him if it was the right car, and he told me it wasn't, but the BMW or A5 wouldn't be available until tonight,  so I could take this and come back later to exchange.  That was fine for me, we were taking a day trip to Grand Canyon.  We took the less expensive convertible, enjoyed the day.

I returned later that night, and just like the reviews said, it was a mad house.  There were customers everywhere, and it was a little chaotic.

Wie in jedem Supermarkt gibt es jede Woche interessante Preisangebote quer durch's Sortiment - so kann auch Student sich Marken-Schnittkäse (150g originall Leerdammer für 0,99 EUR) und Philadelphia (3er-Pack für 1,75 EUR =  60ct pro Packung!) leisten. Obst&Gemüse sind auch Abends noch massig vorhanden - Preis&Leistung ist Ansichtssache, aber auch hier gibt es saisonale und wöchentliche Angebot (zuletzt z.B. Bananen für 0,79 EUR das Kilo). Was ich damit sagen möchte ist Folgendes: wenn man Ausgefalleneres sucht (wenn z.B. Indisch-Kochen angesagt ist) oder man einfach nicht die Lust hat, in 3 verschieden Supermärkte zu gehen, findet man hier eigentlich immer was man sucht - eventuell kostet's eben mehr als bei Aldi&Co - muss aber nicht!

The second time we came though, it was bad. We were seated fast again which was nice. We ordered and then we waited for our food.

The most important thing to know is that this ride is soo much more delicious with a deal. Why pay full price for a 30 minute experience when you can buy a half priced deal on Groupon\/Living Social? I had a lot of fun on the High Roller, but mostly because of the great deal we got. And also because I am the champion of any open bar, and was able to get about 8 drinks in before we landed. 

The view from the High Roller is amazing. I loved the idea of having a 360 degree view, so that it didn't matter where you stood, you could see everything! The ride goes super slow, so there is plenty of time to soak everything in. 

I enjoyed myself. Would I do it again? Possibly. It's a nice change of pace from lots of other activities you can partake in on the Strip.

When we arrived, I told Justin, who has been her teacher for years, that it was her last day. She has been in the Silver I class with him since November, never leveling up despite all of her hard work (it's a Gold class, she's Silver). Multiple times there were 4 kids in the class, not allowing our daughter ample time with Justin. He also trained a lot of people over this year, so partly working with her, partly not. It's a lot for a 4 year old.

Justin hardly interacted with our daughter during class today, mostly focusing on the person he was training. We like him, usually, and his no nonsense attitude when teaching the kids (my husband and I are both teachers ourselves), but the last few months he has been less encouraging and really less nice to the kids he teaches.

My daughter left in tears today. She has worked so hard, come so far and all she will remember from today is him saying to her, ""Can you count?!"" while she did her breast stroke, instead of how proud he was of all her hard work.

I think he could have been a little nicer, more compassionate and caring, and paid a little more attention after all these years, knowing she wasn't coming back.

Our daughter used to love swimming here, used to love Justin, but over this year has come to dread going. He was too hard on her, didn't accommodate for the fact that she was in a Gold class as a Silver, was not encouraging and sometimes was even mean. He is the reason we are not attending all the way through Gold classes. 

I am disappointed for how things went today, disappointed for my daughter. We had a present for her, a little trophy and high hopes that she would make it through Silver 1 before leaving, and none of it happened. She didn't even want her picture taken.

This place is located within a shopping strip that has quite a few asian quisine's to choose from.  The reason I chose here was because it was exclusively a carry out joint.  I just wanted to grab a bite, take it home, and eat.

So, I enter the place, and its kind of drab, and not really appealing to the eye.  It appears to be a delievery\/carry out joint, with NO seating.  So, I review the menu, and place my order for sweet and sour chicken.  The girl behind the counter was warm and friendly, and answered the few questions that I had.

I was kind of iffy about this place. It's not in horrible shape, but it really needs a good cleaning and some updating.  I felt it was kinda dumpy looking.  But, it was late, I was hungry, and I didn't want to be to pessimistic.

Well, I got the food home, and ate it.  It was fine.  But, I ended up getting sick later on that night.

Amazing, above and beyond caring staff, friendly and skilled massage therapist that really learn where all the aches and pains are, and Dr. Michael Sobran is the best. 

I started coming to Progressive Health Center in beginning of July after I had been rear ended in a car accident. I had been referred to the office by a client of mine, and funny I was suffering from laryngitis so I couldn't call to make the appointment. My client handed off my phone number to Progressive Health Center, and I rather quickly almost instantly got a text message from the front desk staff Karen, asking for when I could come in for treatment. That whole situation and texting me to help avoid straining my voice was so thoughtful and she didn't have to do that, but went out of her way to text me to help me get in ASAP for treatment from the accident. 

This was also my first car accident I was in, where I was the only passenger in my vehicle. So in regards to filing a claim, getting a lawyer, all that jazz.. I was not too familiar with at all. Dr. Sobran was so helpful and informative, and thankful he was able to refer me to a wonderful car accident attorney. I'm so thankful for that, otherwise I would have been lost. 

The office is located in the southwest area before the area turns into Mountain's Edge, but not quite south Summerlin. Very beautiful and clean office with such an amazing friendly staff. The building name above the door is Micro Spa and they have other Dr's all in this office as well that offer different herbal\/alternative therapies. But I'm solely reviewing on Progressive Health Center with Dr. Sobran

Now when I used to think of Chiropractor,  I used to just think.. imma get my back cracked and realigned. But Dr. Sobran uses several different state of the art equipment to target more individualized therapy. Even before you see the Chiropractor, they have a lumbar bed and the most amazing massage chair on the side of the waiting area, that patients have access to, while waiting for their appointment. And just saying.. it really is the most amazing massage chair I've ever experienced.. it has this zero gravity setting so you're basically reclined upside down. it's bad ass!

and speaking of using the lumbar bed or the chair while waiting... there really is never a wait. I can normally get to my appointment 5mins early and I will be seen right then. Only a handful of times have I waited more than 5mins to be seen. So when do I get in the amazing massage chair? After my appointment hehe :) I just tell the front desk I'm gonna get in the massage chair or the lumbar bed to stretch me out. 

Dr. Sobran has used trigger therapy, lazer therapy, the lumbar bed, and different equipments I don't know the name of, to help in my road to recovery. Along with all the therapy he provides, I'm usually scheduled once or twice a week with a massage therapist that targets areas where I'm experiencing pain from the accident. Nicole, Katherine, and Kat are all so amazing. Each very personable, and I believe genuinely care about the patients they are working on. I always feel 100% comfortable here.

and Dr. Sobran is not just a great Chiropractor, but he's a wonderful and delightful person. He always asks how's your day going and it's a genuine conversation, like he really gets to know his patients on a personal level. always asks how the weekend was and what I did, and really makes conversation with his patients. I've been recommending this place because of all the wonderful experience I've had during my time of therapy! I will probably still come back even after my accident case is closed just because they are that good!!

I had the worst AC technician (Ken) ever. I called them because the drain for the condensation tank was plugged. I suggested that he use compressed air and blow the line out and he recommended a ""nitrogen flush"". Well I never heard of this so I thought he's the expert. He then went and inspected my condenser. This is where it got good. He recommended 2 lbs. of R22 at a cost of $290. The unit was blowing cold air. if it was down 2 lbs. it would not blow cold. The fan motor is supposed to pull .8 amps. it was pulling .87 amps."" You need to get that replaced because it is going to fail this summer."" Really! that is utterly ridiculous. Oh and that nitrogen flush is $125.00. There were other ridiculous charges  on the bill that brought it up to $1240.00 but  that wasn't the worse of it. After he gave me the estimate i realized that this company is in the business of fleecing customers I just wanted to get him out of my apartment.When he put everything back together I had to tell him how to put the AC filters in. He put them in wrong. I don't blame him for his inexperience, i blame the company for their lack of training. From my experience this company trains their employees to use scare tactics of catastrophic failure on their customers. Rich Morgan wrote a response to my review. he did bring up some valid points. Now let me tell the rest of the story. I did not go with the estimate that was given to me by ken. Instead I called another AC company and they came out and unplugged the condensation drain with a vacuum instead of the $125.00 nitrogen flush. Savings $125.00. it did not end there. The unit quit blowing cold the next day after Magic Touch was there. I then called the reputable AC company to see what was wrong. the valve on the suction side was  loose causing the freon to leak out. The magic Touch Tech did not check the valves after taking his gauges off. Cost of new Freon $529.00.

We sat at the bar and didn't get a hello. Nor did we get menus. We sat for a few minutes before she slowly walked around to come wipe down the bar in front up each one of us without saying excuse me, hello, nothing. She went back behind the bar and continued cleaning glasses. Finally handed us 2 menus for 5 people. Still no hello. I had to ask a couple minutes later for a 3rd menu.....a couple of us just shared menus. About 5minutes later she walked over with a piece of paper and said ""what are you guys gonna get?"".....yeah, hello to you too. The first person ordered her beer and before she could even say what she wanted to eat the lady moved on to the next person. Normally this is okay but after almost 15 minutes of not being acknowledged I think we have had enough time to decide what we wanna eat. 
So, this place's burgers are al a carte and I understand we should pay attention to the menu but it's almost unheard of that your burger comes with no side. So my friend got her burger and wondered where the fries where. She was informed she can buy fries for $4. Fine. But it should go without saying that when such a common item soo commonly comes w a side the waitress should explain while ordering that you can add a side if you like. the guy next to us had the same problem. So, tipped her 15% and i didn't wanna give her anything but my fiance used to work in restaurants and won't let me leave less than 15%. Anyways, as we were walking out my fiance gave her the benefit of the doubt to say goodbye and he told her ""have a great night!"". She didn't look, respond, nothing. We were invisible, all 5 of us, walking in and again walking out. Never going there again because I refuse to support someones success when the owner won't even greet customers. Horrible service.

Whenever one dish would run-out, they would bring out a totally different dish in its place. So I knew what we were eating was fresh (for a buffet haha). I guess that's also a downer though.

Dr. Kalaf is extremely personable, knowledgeable and thorough, and I always feel confident when she is treating me. I feel like it is always easy to tell when your dentist is well-trained, intelligent and cares about their patients, and Dr. Kalaf does. Nicole, on her staff, is also wonderful! She is always so positive and goes out of her way to make people feel comfortable, which I really appreciate. The front desk always returns my calls promptly and Rachel is always flexible and helpful when I need to move appointments.

The facility itself is very modern, clean and updated. They have little touches to make you more comfortable-- such as watching a movie, listening to Pandora, massage chairs (though I don't use them) and silly little painted ""skylights"" (the one I looked at today had a cat randomly sitting in clouds). If you're going to be anywhere sitting in a chair anywhere for a few hours, you mine as well do it looking at a cat in clouds, right?",6,1,1,"""Solon Dental Excellence""",,"""6165 Som Center Rd""",Solon,OH,44139,41.3918245,-81.4371617,4.5,17,1,Dentists;Health & Medical;Endodontists;Periodontists;Cosmetic Dentists

My mom has vascular dementia and really needed her medication refilled from Mountain Vista Geriatric Psych facility.  Mom has vascular dementia which causes paranoia, hallucinations, and anxiety.  

Mom had refused to go to the doctor if I mentioned the her Numenda, so I told the front desk person that she takes it, but please do not mention it or she will become very upset.  So, the doctor comes in and near the beginning of her health history interview, mentions the Numenda I repeatedly asked them not to bring up.

Then I get a letter saying that she can no longer be our doctor because my mom and I are unprofessional.  Since when do patients have to be professional, especially patients with vascular dementia.  I would never recommend this doctor.  I think her arrogant and unsympathetic.

They had a set price menu for $28, starter, main and dessert.  There were 3 starts to choose from, 3 mains and a desert so there was choice for someone to mix and match.  I opted out of this as I didn't feel like having a dessert last night.

I ordered a bean dip and bread, pickled beets and pappardelle with maple smoked trout.

The bean dip and bread was very good.  The dip came warm with some oil on top and had a great texture and consistency.  The flavour was very subtle but very nice.  The pickled beets were awesome.  I don't like beets but I've been slowly growing on them so decided to try these.  They are not like pickled beets you would get at a shawarma joint, rather large slices of beets (like sliced apples) that were pickled but they weren't sour and a bit sweet.  I really like them and need to figure out how to make these on my own.

The main was what knocked a star off.  The pasta was really good, the things I did not like about this dish was that I couldn't really taste any maple on the trout until the last 2 bites.  This might have been caused by something that was extremely bitter in the dish.  I couldn't make out what it was but the flavours in the dish could have been very interesting.  I mean maple and trout, licorice\/fennel\/anise but whatever was extremely bitter (not just slightly) might have thrown the flavour off from the rest of the dish.

Will I try this place again?  Most definitely but I'm going to try to avoid food with those flavours in the future.",1,0,2,"""Brockton General""",Little Portugal,"""1321 Dundas Street W""",Toronto,ON,M6J 1Y1,43.6493943,-79.4263145,4.0,37,0,Canadian (New);Restaurants;American (New)

ERUTjgCX1v4ZowK2P9Rdvg,W6CrBiuPNADGDIH_m39_aw,poseWgWvWjANMR3wqrO_yw,2015-11-06,"Unfortunately the Samsung refrigerator at Best Buy that we loved, turned out to be 2"" too wide to fit through our kitchen doorway. The delivery guy said that the fridge door would have to be removed to get it through the doorway, but that he couldn't do that, Best Buy would have to do that. I phoned the Best Buy Weston store 3 times but no one picked up. So I went to the store in person, where they explained they were short staffed & only one person was assigned to pick up the phone, sorry. Seriously?! 

It turned out that taking the fridge door off requires a special delivery with special authorization from Best Buy. Talk about red tape! Also I would have to wait till Tuesday for this, as there were no deliveries on the weekend and we needed a day's notice to book the delivery again. Lesson learned: never get an appliance delivered on a Friday! So we had to put all the food that we'd taken out of the old fridge back, which took an hour.

But when the delivery guys came back Tuesday, the new fridge still wouldn't fit through the doorway even with the door removed. It was suggested to us that we hire a handyman at our own expense to widen the kitchen door frame. Ever tried to get a handyman to come the same day? Forget it! So we spent several days dodging the new fridge blocking the hallway, waiting for a handyman. When no handyman would even come till a week later, we gave up on that idea in frustration, as our old fridge was leaking constantly (which is why we needed a new one in the first place).

Finally we called Best Buy store again and asked to speak to the manager. The manager Kevin finally solved the problem, bless him. He arranged to exchange the new fridge for an LG refrigerator of even better quality at the same price, which would fit once its door was removed and screwed back on.

So a week later, we finally have a working new fridge and we are very happy with it. Ultimate lesson learned: always measure the dimensions of your doorway with a tape measure before buying a new refrigerator.",1,1,0,"""Best Buy""",,"""2625A Weston Road""",Toronto,ON,M9N 3V8,43.7112806678,-79.5322984904,2.0,9,1,Local Services;Appliances;Electronics;IT Services & Computer Repair;Computers;Shopping;Home & Garden

I split the Zocalo Quesadila Supreme, with chicken, minus the jalapenos.  It was delicious.

The combination of chewy and crispy, and all the other quesadila ingredients was great.  It is enough to share, if you aren't ridiculously hungry.

Just getting to it was stressful enough as you had to meander throughout the main pool area filled with kids and puddles of water (don't wear your best sandals).
Once you enter you are greeted and handed a card with your scheduled treatment on it and ""upgrade options"" which are available...solicitation #1.
You do not fill out any profile as do e at other elite spas-so of you have anything medical which they should be aware of or preferences, oh well.
The locker room is small and the jacuzzi is in the middle next to the dressing area, do try and relax listening to blow dryers and chatty women :-(
There is no your of the facility to speak of-essentially here is your locker and go to the lounge and someone will call for you. Then again, not much to tour.
When you leave the locker and also when you go to your treatment room\/and finish you are walked past the retail botique filled with fully dressed shoppers-a bit uncomfortable.
The lounge is from previous experience should be utilized to quite the mind-there was nothing quiet about it!!!
A lady was interviewing someone there, staff regularly entered for a water or juice and chatted as of it were the employee lunch room with no respect for the client. The lady who seemed to have been in charge of keeping the area stocked banged doors, buckets and anything else she could find.
Needless to say I already knew I was set for a disappointing experience.
Staff should be invisible-their presence is felt everywhere as they are talking ongst themselves in the halls, in unused treatment rod, on the dressing area....you get my point.
The treatment itself was ok any if there was any high point it was quickly overshadowed by continuous solicitations to upgrade your oils, type of massage etc.etc.  These account for solicitations 2,3,4,5 & 6.
The closing act of the treatment was some enzyme spray must that I felt 2 dots of as I was reminded could be purchased at a 20% discount in the retail shop. Solicitation #7.
The Biltmore is a fabulous hotel, but in a destination with some of the best spas they may have served themselves better if they didn't have this spa at all.
If your primary focus is a spa weekend-I'd suggest the Montelicia, JW Camelback , Westin Kierland or Sanctuary over the Biltmore.
If not-the Biltmore is great and filled with history and wonderful diversions throughout the grounds-book an Ocotilla room as if provides multiple hospitality services including an extended continental breakfast and hot and cold apps with beer\/wine complimentary and honor bar.

Once there we waiter for a few mins. nothing crazy though. So we were there on memorial day and the prices were almost double. Once inside, the place is really nice with flowers everywhere and sunny and bright. Waiter comes and takes our drinks order and we proceed to get the food.

Oh the food. Everything was really good and flavorful. Lets see it is me in a buffet so you put 2 and 2 together. I tried salmon pizza, cucumber gazpacho, squid ceviche, stuffed pork, cheese and figs, chicken soup among others and every thing was great. 
There is so much good food that it would be hard to remember everything. Desserts are great as well. I had pecan pie, pina colada cake, chocolate cake and about 6 different flavor icecream that I shared with the group.

Their fish and chips have the right (light) amount of flaky batter, so that the fish is still the stand out star. The quality of fish is great and large, and the pieces were fried perfectly. We tried both the halibut and cod, both of which were amazing, with halibut winning out. The fries are exactly what I expect for my fish and chip order, thicker fries, with a nice texture. 

The seating and feel is very rustic and old school, a no frills restaurant with a family vibe and delicious food. The service is very friendly, and provide both take out and sit down orders.",2,2,1,"""Amy's Fish & Chips""",,"""1285 Elgin Mills Road E, Unit 24""",Richmond Hill,ON,L4S 0B5,43.8961560432,-79.4028151408,4.5,50,1,Restaurants;Fish & Chips;American (Traditional)

Ok, at first, I was excited to check out this show because I was thinking ""For over $100, this should kick ass!"". So me and my lady went and loved the set up with the bamboos and everything. I get the program and I'm like ""Why in the blue hell is this asian play made by a white guy? Oh well...lets not judge....lets give it a try I guess.""  

My god Tyronnnnnnnnnne! This play\/cirque du soleil moonfry was just OK....I loved some aspects of it like how some of the characters come out to you and blah blah blah, but it slows down a lot at times and I actually almost fell asleep.

I mean, this show is worth $20, not no damn $100.

It was still a great experience for me and my lady, but shit...that over $200 we paid should have gone to other things or atleast towards a bad-ass concert or wrestling or UFC event! hahahaha!

KA is an Americanized Cirque Du Soleil and if you have money to throw away, then check it out I guess... I would rather try the Cirque Du Soleil with the water.

-There's so much more you can do with $100

Javier's allure is its atmosphere as much as its convenient location in the svelte Aria.  Everything in Vegas that is worth seeking out is ""through the casino.""  We passed raucous sports bars and slot machine cha-chinging walkups before choosing Javier's for its quieter mood.  It has metal studded ceilings, carved wood banquets, and heavy leather table tops and lounge seating  The piped in music was definitely an amusing background - looping on reggae during our hour's visit.  

We added to the cosmopolitan mix by ordering French martinis - not cheap at $17 each.  A value totally underestimated until we rose to our feet and discovered the liquid power that could have launched us to  the ionosphere.  But since we only hoped to get to the show ""through the casino,""  the libations were perfect rocket boosters.

Food served at the adjoining table showed impressive presentation.  I can only tell you about the chips that were served warm next to attractive cups of red and green salsa.

Speaking of feet.  Yes, see paragraph 3.  My friend was suffering from all those trips Through the Casino.  The kindly waitress dipped into her own purse and presented three bandaids to sooth the blister that surfaced while one toe fought with the other to be first on the escalator, tram, revolving door, taxi, carpet, marble floor, etcetera etcetera...An interesting, very girl-to-girl, hospitable way to earn a well-deserved tip.",2,1,2,"""Javier's""",The Strip,"""3730 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1073254139,-115.176578961,4.0,1042,1,Nightlife;Mexican;Bars;Restaurants

Additionally, there is a make your own Bloody Mary Bar, that I would be interesting in trying the next time that I am there, because there will be a next time. 

I had the Biscuits and Gravy with Eggs and Bacon. I was surprised when the food arrived and my friend's husband, who had eaten there before laughed and said, ""Yeah they don't skimp on the food portions."" The gravy was a chipotle like gravy and the biscuits were so fluffy and delicious. 

The waitress that was working our section, I think was the only waitress in the area, which included several tables and a party of 20+ people. This is to say that she kept up with all her tables, was apologetic as necessary and friendly when she needed to be. Her service was the extra star that kept my rating at a ""Woohoo"" status.

Going into the room, the host asked who was the most brave and since I had the most experience, I volunteered. 

When the game began, I spent the first 6 minutes in a small room with literally nothing to do while the other room had to figure out how to open the door. It had nothing to do with ""bravery"" and I started the game essentially losing 14% of the game playing time. 

I had high hopes for this room since it was very expensive and was less time than most games. I've played 25 rooms and usually average $35 for a 60 minute room. This game was $50 for 45 minutes, which is $1.11 per minute compared to $0.58 per minute. And by losing those first 6 minutes locked in a room not contributing, it was like money being flushed away. 

Then, once I got into the study, the game wasn't much better. I've played much better games with better puzzles. There were a few occasions where we got stuck on red herrings and just didn't know what to do. The game masters weren't responsive at all to providing hints. I suspect they were more interested in the group of 10 playing in the other room at the time. 

Another example of poor game play was that the phone rang several times with messages that had nothing to do with the game. One asked that I stay on the line for 30 seconds so they could find us. In a game that is only 45 minute, a 1 minute meaningless phone call is just sucking away time from the room. And there were several phone calls like this. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this room at this expensive price or even at a discount.

Cheaper to split a half dozen or dozen (plus no tax) with friends so you can share and sample different donuts at once; then you can go back and purchase ones that you like.

Nice clean store but no washroom. Wonderful staff that are willing to bend over backwards to accommodate your needs; they set aside some donuts for me since they were running out of certain items and my friends hadn't  arrived yet.

Recommendations:
- Sappy Pig (Maple dipped, sprinkled with bacon, with Valrhona chocolate and peanut butter drizzle) sweet and savoury and was surprisingly our group's top pick.
- Triple Chocolate (Dark chocolate ganache and milk and white chocolate drizzle) - the dark chocolate ganache was to die for!!!!!
- Blueberry lime (Blueberry lime dip, oat streusel crumble, white chocolate drizzle) - nice flavors and pretty presentation.

The above mentioned donuts were light and fluffy, just the way I like them. It seems like the donuts they split in half to add a filling were on the chewy side (Pucker Up Sucker and Crème Brûlée), definitely not my thing!

I always had good service. Place started going downhill about two years ago. I stopped spending my money there. I decided to try it out again last Sunday. Soon as we set down the waitress comes over and had an attitude right from the start. Then she kept referring to my boyfriend as honey. My family owns successful bars in AZ, none of the workers refer to customers this way. It's not professional or appropriate in my opinion. My boyfriend was annoyed by the fact she felt so comfortable to do so. We went to watch a baseball game, then it switched off. Of course the waitress was no where to be found. I had to finally get up and ask what happened to the game to another server. We missed a whole inning. Felt like the waitress should of told us it got moved to another channel. Then the mimosa I ordered was terrible, worst drink I've ever had. Waitress comes over and tells me, well no one else has complained about them honey. Really sweetie pants is what I wanted to say. Unless your Flo, and you tell me to kiss your grits while filling up my drink, don't use a term of endearment towards me or anyone else I'm siting with. It's condescending and your way to young to call me that. Save it for kids, and your close family. Not strangers, I'm not your honey. I could of seriously even overlooked that. Having an attitude and not fixing the drink issue is what set me off. I then talked to the manager who didn't look over 21. She really didn't seem to care about my experience, told me all the young servers refer to everyone as honey including her. Drink was not taken off the bill. Called and spoke with Lee the general manager, he asked me why I waited a week to call, really? Like is everyone working there a complete jack a--? He then tells me well come in and I'll buy you a new drink. Nope Lee, how about you train the staff on customer service. Sounds like you need some as well. I'm a business owner and I would never treat customers like that. Lee acted like I was bothering him on a Sunday and had no empathy, just like the manager girl. Steer clear of this place. I refuse to spend money at an establishment that feels like they can treat customers like crap. I can go next door to Maddogs. The service is great and you all should take a lesson from your competition. If I was the owner, I'd  get rid of this general manager, and the incompetent manager child.

(not to be confused with the Brewery, also in downtown Champaign, which just opened recently) is a full-service bar in downtown Champaign. The Blind Pig (as I will refer to it for the rest of this entry) differentiates itself from other local bars by offering a HUGE selection of microbrews on tap (well over 20 at any one time) , as well as a large selection of beer by the bottle. This huge selection is one of the reasons this is my favorite bar in Champaign, as well as the fact that you can get a five beer sampler (of any draft beer) for just $8.

The Blind Pig changes its menu weekly, with different beers entering and leaving each time. Another thing I like about the Pig is the fact that it is one of the few places I know of where you can get beer in a cask, which is just for unfiltered beer, and lets the beer continue to age and ferment while it is being stored. Considering the rarity of cask beer, at least in my experience, this alone is a good enough reason to stop by the Bling Pig. There is a different Cask every week.

The Blind Pig also has special events at different times, depending on when the event takes place. These events usually involve some sort of drink special or giveaways. As an example, I attended the Blind Pig's 5th anniversary party just a few weeks ago. A representative from Rogue Ales, one of the first microbreweries in America, was present, and giving away t-shirts. I was lucky enough to get one when I got a Rogue Old Crustacean Barleywine (which was delicious). In addition, there was a selection of 6 Rogue drafts and a Rogue cask, with all pints being $5 each (a rather good deal for Rogue at the Blind Pig).

The Pig tends to draw an older, off-campus crowd. As such, it is usually less crowded and rowdy than on-campus bars, though it gets busier on weekends. One of the reasons I like to go to the Blind Pig is that it offers a different kind of atmosphere that one cannot find in other bars (especially those on campus), as well as the superior beer selection.",3,0,0,"""The Blind Pig Company""",,"""120 N Walnut St""",Champaign,IL,61820,40.11698563,-88.242283532,4.0,178,1,Beer;Wine & Spirits;Pubs;Food;Nightlife;Bars

Great place for romantic dates, anniversaries and the like until everyone else started using it for the same, which is not a bad thing. Well, it was for me as I noticed the prices creep up a bit. 

The locale is set underground in a basement, however they have given it a very cave like feel. A very well addressed cave mind you. With low-ceilings, lots of yellow lighting and a level service which never disappointed me, I can only give this restaurant high praises. 

The chairs are wooden and the tables have an old world vibe. Funny enough, the decor strikes me more as Mediterranean than strictly souther Italian as I once was at a restaurant in Sevilla that looked just like this place. 

Now, the restaurant is on the small side so expect to feel it a little cramped on Friday and Saturday nights when is generally packed. For some privacy, I recommend the small room on the north-east side of the restaurant on the room on the right. Only a few tables there and a bit less server traffic.

The wine selection is very good and their pastas & desserts (their forte) can achieve levels of culinary orgasm  -- sometimes. Either way, expect the Italian style meal where you will have an aperitivo, antipasti, primo, secondo.. etc all the way to Caffè or Digestivo. So by the end, expect to be feel full & satisfied.   

Of course you pay for it, so for a great meal for two, expect a good $200 as base. I very much recommend Sotto Sotto to anyone who wants a semi-authentic rustic Italian meal.

But then I thought I should probably venture out of the nut sack and experience different flavours - ones that I've never tried before.

Although it didn't really encompass any hint of marshmallow flavour, it was the creamiest, smoothest, ice cream I have ever tasted.  The caramel was to die for and I don't usually like caramel... I would say that this should've been named Caramel Flan or Creme Caramel instead of Burnt Marshmallow.

They use all of these high quality and expensive ingredients and end up making a burger that just tastes like a bunch of shit thrown together.  That's really is what a burger is, but if I'm going to spend $10+ for one, I want it to be remarkable.

Gordon Ramsay seems to be aware of that problem.  Every ingredient in every sandwich at Gordon Ramsay Burgr stands on its own.  Every one of the items has character.  You can get burgers for a dollar almost anywhere.  GR Burgr justifies the costs.

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS:

Farm Burger: Everybody has a bacon and egg burger on their menu, but somehow GR Burgr does it incredibly right.  It's hard not to love duck breast bacon, but what impressed me was that you could somehow taste the egg behind all of the fattyness of the beef, the bacon, and the delicious buns they use.  Highly recommended.

Hell's Kitchen Burger: This one has kick.  The spiciness of the peppers are tempered by the cooling effect of the avocado, all of which supplement the buns and beef very well.  Also recommended.

Parmesan Truffle Fries: If you're a fan of either I probably don't even have to tell you they're good.  The fries are perfectly cooked with delicious potato-ness but also substantial crispiness.  The sauces they come with are worth licking from the bowl... not that I did that.

CONCLUSION

Call me crazy, but I found myself comparing Gordon Ramsay's burgers with some upscale  maki sushi I've had.  Each one had a complex and long lasting flavor with well balanced ingredients.  Yet, they are still burgers, so they can also be enjoyed casually.  Burgr is the first and possibly the only Gordon Ramsay restaurant I'll ever eat at, but as far as I can tell... this guy definitely knows his stuff.",3,0,2,"""Gordon Ramsay BurGR""",The Strip,"""3667 Las Vegas Blvd S""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.110724,-115.172169,4.0,5447,0,American (Traditional);Burgers;Restaurants

When will you open up a ""Lee's Discount Liquor"" in Maryland?  Like In-N-Out burger, your store(s) is one of the top 5 things I miss about not living in Las Vegas anymore:(

Anyway, Nevada is one of those lovely states that allows liquor to be sold in gas stations, grocery stores, convenience stores, etc., etc.  making access to alcohol very easy (my kind of state).  With that being said, it is not all that necessary to go out of one's way to shop at a liquor store.  Well, let me just say that this place makes it WELL worth going out of your way.  I have yet to find as wide array of wine\/beer\/liquor under one roof with this degree of competitive prices.  I love Lee's so much that every time I take a trip to Vegas, I drive out of my way to stop here to stock up on alcohol to store in my hotel room fridge.  Maybe my love for Lee's has to do with all of the lovely evenings, nights, and ummm, early mornings that I can and can't remember,  that all started with an innocent stop to Lee's but even years later, now that I am more mature (or not), I still think Lee's is the ""bee's knees!",1,0,0,"""Lee's Discount Liquor""",,"""4427 E Sunset Rd""",Henderson,NV,89014,36.069495,-115.0764259,3.5,39,1,Food;Beer;Wine & Spirits

The beer. What can I say about the beer? Oh yeah, not much because they can never seem to keep their taps in product. The only thing regularly available are some of the IPAs that the staff wont even touch.

The music is so loud, even during down times (except at closing) is usually pumped up so loud that there is no talking to the person sitting at the bar next to you. The secondary bar has NO seating.

Also, what is up with the closing hours? Either stay open, or post an earlier closing time.

Coming into Sujeo on a Saturday night at 8 pm, I was warned it was an hour-hour and a half wait. Okay, we can have a few cocktails next door then come back. Add me to the Noshlist. 

When we came back in to Sujeo to grab a drink an hour after being added to the list, we were again greeted, and started looking at the cocktail menu. At this time, our table was ready. We were seated, ordered cocktails and started to browse the menu. Our server approached a few moments after we were seated to explain the menu and to tell us of the daily specials. For a first time visitor and someone not well versed in Korean\/Asian cuisine I feel that this is the moment they might become overwhelmed. Our friendly server made it as concise as possible while still giving good details. We placed our app order of potstickers and spring roll, and continued to look at the menu for our entrée option. I settled on the Bun, the second half settled on the pork shoulder bibimbap. The apps came out very quickly and were very good. They were hot, well put together, well seasoned. 

The entrees also came out rather quickly (but enough time to finish apps first) and very hot. The bibimbap comes out in a large HOT stone bowl meant to continue\/finish cooking the bibimbap as one mixes it all in. I thoroughly enjoyed each of my many sampling bites I had of this dish. My bun was good, the sauce was a bit more bitter and acidic than I was prepared for but the saltiness from the pork and shrimp cut through that. The pieces of the imperial roll that came inside this entrée were my favorite part (but let's be honest...who ever says ""no, I didn't enjoy that deep friend piece of heaven?"").

I do like that part of the restaurant is noodle bar, part seating for the restaurant.

For the last year or so, we've been on the lookout for a casual sports bar that serves good (read: outstanding), affordable food. The more people we talked to about this quite obvious void in Montreal's dining-watering hole scene, the more our hopes and dreams began to wane. Until... walking home one night along Ontario, just east of St. Denis, we came across Abreuvoir's unmistakable sign. We peered through the window. Wood interior, many tables and banquettes, a huge bar in the middle of the space, flat-screen TVs everywhere. This little Nancy Drew was onto something. We returned on a weeknight to watch the Habs game, grab some food and see what Abreuvoir has to offer. Three little words: C'EST LE BUT!

During the warmer months, we flock to the Old Port, Place Émilie-Gamelin, the Olympic Stadium, or wherever we heard whispers of an appearance, to taste their delicious offerings. Last summer, we fell in love with Lucky's Truck's at the Just for Laughs Food Souk, where we devoured a delicious pulled pork sandwich and a duck confit chip-poutine. Well, it just so happens that during the winter, the gang from Lucky's Truck runs the food out of Abreuvoir. Their current menu features mini pogos, wings, grilled cheese, hamburgers, mac n' cheese and a hockey night special. If we had to choose just one out of all these delicious items, it's hands down the poutine dish aptly names ""La Fameuse"". Incidentally we visited during Montreal's Poutine Week and we vouch that this is a top contender when it comes to Pout', for 3 reasons: (1) thin, double fried fries (2) the foie gras in the sauce makes you warm and fuzzy, adds to the decadence of the dish. Also, perfect amount of gravy, the fries don't turn into soggy goopiness (3) the toppings: the duck confit is very moist and does not overwhelm the dish + generous amount of cheese curds. We could continue deconstructing this marvellous poutine, but we think you get the point. Change of topic, 5$ beer specials!

Atmosphere: It's game night so everyone's pumped. We liked that there is a lot of seating available, even though some of the stool tables are very small. The layout works well because the place is packed but doesn't feel claustrophobic. The sound of the hockey game was a little loud for our personal liking but we imagine that's the point (to drown out nagging girlfriends........... we're onto you guys). It's refreshing to be in a place where everyone - sports enthusiast or not- are having a good time and people are friendly regardless of the language you speak; as opposed to the creepy rowdiness of other sports bars *cough*StationDeSport*cough*. We love love love the huge outdoor terrace, that rivals even the best of them (think, Ste-Elizabeth). It has it's own outdoor bar, music speakers, heaters for the colder months and tables on different levels.

You'll Wanna Know
Abreuvoir is more than just a sports bar. In fact, when there isn't a game on, Abreuvoir hosts 5 à 7s, promoted special events, Djs, (punk) rock bands, burlesque shows, karaoke and vernissages. Oh, we almost forgot to mention, Wednesdays is Comedy Night for professionals and amateurs. The shows are held downstairs in the basement, a space that has more of a club-like feel. This lower-level is also the perfect place to have a friday or saturday night dance-off. Seriously, there's so much going on that every night of the week is a potential party. Check out their website for a list of upcoming events.

I have been twice since they opened. On both occasions the quality of the fish was excellent, extremely fresh.

It's not just the fish though, they have a great menu which brings together many different styles of cuisine from Japan.

I have been to quite a few all you can eat sushi places in Las Vegas, they usually bloat you up with a bunch of rice and overdone rolls. Not here, the all you can eat option includes regular sushi as well as rolls (including almost all of the special rolls) and other options like Japanese curry and Korean BBQ beef (which we didn't get to eat because our 1 year old devoured it, the guys were cool about that which was another plus in my book).

On this particular visit, I didn't have much time to spare, but a uniquely pretty strapless dress caught my eye. Although I didn't see my size, one of the girls working knew that a mannequin in the display window had just what I wanted - and quickly took down and brought the dress in my size over to me.

I loved the dress and modeled it briefly, mentioning I wished my husband could ""okay"" it. . .the sweet girls helping me asked where my husband was (he was outside on a bench) and what his name was (""Oh, his name is Jose, there can't be too many of those walking around Hudson!"") - before I could barely respond, my husband was there in front of me smiling and telling me I had to get the dress.

They also have a lot of drink options, from bubble teas to special mixed drinks. 

I've never had an issue with customer service here. My orders have always been correct and served really quickly.

I booked them 1 month before the wedding and needed only the basics: wedding party (bouquets and boutonnieres), lots of family boutonnieres and some decorations for the cake.

Service was on the poor side in person: 
I sent my mom to gather information. I armed her with plenty of pictures of the type of bouquets I wanted but Willbe Bloomin rudely turned her down. They insisted that their wedding florist could only meet on Saturdays with brides who have filled out their questionnaire and would not volunteer any info.

I was ready to move on, but their location was key (very easy pick up for my morning portraits) and I needed to get things done. I was also swayed by the unanimous 5 star reviews on Yelp and gave them another chance.

Come wedding day, despite telling them my colour scheme, one of the key colours was not there. The grooms boutonniere lasted 2 hours and did not hold up well. The pin was poorly balanced and we re-pinned the boutonniere so many times that the lapel on his tux was quite ruined. The family boutonnieres had the same problem. They kept falling off and in the end half the people ditched their boutonnieres which I was very sad to see.

I especially like the scam they run with the containers. In case you haven't heard this one before, they automatically put your tea into a tin.

The Owner Larry was attentive & informative during the three days we had to plan the menu I wanted. He said whatever we'd like to be served, he could make it happen, and that we just needed to give the head count a day or two prior to the event. I decided, he came up with a quote and a contract, I signed it, scanned it back over to him, we spoke on the phone to make my payments. Easy Peasy.

I booked the location sight unseen. However they have a cool 360 tour on their website, and it looked amazing. We were not disappointed. 

We arrived an hour and a half before our event was to start. We walked into table and chairs set up perfectly, and with the linen colors of our choice. We didnt bring very many items to decorate, 10 centerpieces, tealight candles, our dessert table and two banners to be hung. SIDE NOTE: They do not allow tape on their walls as it may ruin the stucco\/texturing that they have. It was not an issue for us as we just hung one fabric banner\/bunting onto the metal beams they have (cool artsy industrial beams), and we tied the other to the metal pole mounts they have. The metal poles are awesome! They are adjustable and you can move\/slide them around to fit on most any spaces on their wall. 

Our buffet dinner was amazing. Food was hot and delicious, our water glasses were kept filled all night and our dishes were cleared in a timely manner. Their audio\/video system was perfectly crisp, and everyone was able to hear the ceremony. They play their own soft background music, but you are welcomed to use your own. We used our wedding coordinators music for an hour or so, but I didnt even end up using my playlist after that, we went right back to the music they have on rotation.

The staff and the Owner were helpful and gracious throughout the night. 

Pretty decor, ample parking, CLEAN facility, and a modern and fresh ambiance. There is an outdoor area with lighting, plus an outdoor upstairs patio. They're located next to the police station which gives you a feeling of being safe. Well, my guests did. Your party may feel intimidated if they're a bit wild, however we were told they never bother. 

We plan to hopefully come here on their dinner nights they have every weekend or so, depending on when the venue is booked.

So it goes like this. I call in and talk to Lenny, a not so friendly older gentleman on the phone and explain my issue. Its an Acura that the freon was accidentally released out of during the changing of some valve cover gaskets. I knew the car just needed to be recharged and then it would be good to go. His response was well i dont know how much freon would be needed but chances are you would be looking at $65-$70. I said no problem since the going rate is from $50-80 depending where you go so the car went to the shop the very next day. 

Upon arrival i talked to Lenny, and said we spoke yesterday and he remembered me so i thought great we are on the same page. Let me sow you where the freon was released from and you can take it from there. He gave me a quote $160, and i said whatever the hell for. And the response was well i said i didnt know how much freon the car needed.

I would say that Ive come here once every other month for the past two years and I've never had a bad experience. My friends and I love to play board games so we're the type of group that can spend up to 6 hours here.

What's great about this cafe is pretty much everything. And it's gotten better as the years have passed. The base price for playing is 6$. With that you can play as long as you want. They also have a great menu. I suggest the macaroni and cheese or the quesadilla. The chips and dip to share is good too if you're with a group of people. The drink menu has a great variety as well ranging from Italian sodas to beer to tea to milkshakes. This time that I went I got something new and I ordered a milkshake and a bowl of gummies to share for the table. Both great options if you just want a snack. 

The selection of board games is endless. Every time we go we play some new games, some old ones. A friend of mine is even working on her own game collection so she often buys a game there from the selection they have to offer. I think this is awesome because the game playing can extend into our own homes. If you want a good laugh play the game lift it. 

The vibe is great, it's always packed. If you go on a weekend or something you might have to wait. But there's a lot to do and eat in the area if that's the case. The servers are always helpful.

However, there are some great finds and some really good deals to be had among the tightly packed shelves of Caliban, so it's really a small quibble (mostly because I always end up buying more than I meant to).  Secondly, I really wish they opened a little earlier--sometimes I'd love to drop by at 9 or 10 am and I'm always frustrated that the doors don't open until 11.

OK, so last night (1\/12\/13) we went to the Las Vegas Hotel (formerly the LV Hilton) to see Estaban, someone we had barely heard of and only fleetingly seen years ago in some goofy infomercials for videotaped guitar lessons, complete with a ""man in black"" Johnny Cash-esque outfit.

He was accompanied by some violinist named Teresa Joy, whom we had never heard of.  We went with high hopes, but somewhat lowered expectations, due to lack of familiarity.

OMG!!!  What a show!  Estaban (born Stephen Paul, in Pittsburg, PA) and his daughter, Teresa, were incredible!

Through unshakeable persistence in the early 70's, Steve had become a masters class student of Andres Segovia in Spain, who called him by his Spanish name, Estaban (later came the trademark ponytail, black hat, black outfit, dark shades).  After years of study he was personally endorsed by Segovia, and began touring back in the States.

Tragically, in 1979 he was badly maimed in a car wreck caused by a drunk driver, losing sight in one eye, and the use of his left arm and hand.  He was incapable of playing, but after a decade of struggle was able to rehabilitate himself and learn to play once again.  

Today he plays with such speed, power, passion and virtuosity that you'd never imagine that he had been so badly injured.  He's a towering testament to tenacity.

He packed his performance with music from a number of genres, from classical, pop, Middle Eastern, gypsy and flamenco, to rock and roll.  It was 75 minutes of non-stop, high energy, very heartfelt music, including a touching rendition of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star that was a big hit.

His triple-tune finale was fabulous (two Beatles tunes and his trademark Del Shannon, Runaway) had us all clapping, cheering, stomping, whistling and howling for more.

We met Estaban and Teresa after the show, bought a couple of CDs, and enjoyed a brief chat as he happily signed a photo and both CDs.  He's the ""real deal,"" genuinely enjoying sharing his music with others and interacting with fans.

Which we both now are, in spades!

I've always preferred loose leaf teas and I've hated Teavana because they are so expensive and so pushy so I've resigned myself to drinking tea with tea bags until I moved to Vegas and discovered this store! I had found it on Yelp and saw it was only a couple miles from me so I came down one day to wander around and was very pleasantly surprised. I was greeted when I walked in and she led me directly to the teas where I stood in awe lol. She briefly explained how they were laid out and left me to explore. On my first visit I bought the green tea with ginger and the gunpowder. 

On my other visits I grew more curious and tried the black fruity teas and my favorites are the strawberry and raspberry teas. I also discovered the staff can make up larger bags of tea for you too since I go through the 2 oz bags pretty quick. I usually have them make up 4 oz bags of tea for my favorites, which I think is awesome and those only cost $10.70, which is still a pretty good price! Definitely better than Teavana!

I've bought one or two things of spices and I've looked around at the other things in the store but the tea is what I mainly go to when I go in the store.

I have never stayed in a worse hotel than this and  I have stayed in many over the years in all price ranges. They appear to have begun renovations but abandoned the effort midway through. I asked one of the employees how long the hotel has been ""under comstruction"" and she said a long time and sort of shrugged as if to say there's not much hope of real improvement anytime soon.  Clarion should be embarrassed to have its name associated with this place. 

When I arrived I thought the hotel was abandoned and they had moved but not updated the address online. I thought there was no way in hell this place was operational. Since I already had a reservation, I followed the signs to the back and checked in in a temporary office that had apparently been a hotel room. Even that room was cluttered and gross and unprofessional looking. I would have left except it was late and I was exhausted. 

I got my room key and proceeded down hallways with stained carpets, an empty pizza box, busted doors and missing ceiling tiles. The room turned out to be ok except the furniture was very rickety and unstable. I thought the desk might break when I put my backpack on it. The room seemed clean, but the carpeting was coming up from the floor around the edges of the room. Also, the TV came in fuzzy.

The courtyard was absulutely littered with cigarette butts -- way more than could have accumulated in a few days or weeks or probably even months. The door handle to get back inside is held together with duct tape.

There is a free breakfast but there was no coffee. They told me there was no water in the kitchen to make any. Hmmmm. Are they washing their hands? Washing the serving trays?  

 I can't say enough bad things about this place to truly give you an accurate picture. The photos someone else posted are just a small representation of the awful conditions here. Believe me, the other reviewer did not have to look hard to find those things he photographed.

The last time I ate here was over a year ago and remembered the food was pretty good. Unfortunately that was not the case this time. I felt compelled to write a review after our experience. We ordered the cheese and charcuterie to start. The waitress brought out the wrong order but that is completely forgivable as she corrected it quickly. She said the cheese won a gold star for some cheese award so of course we had to have it. The cheese was well cheese. I am not a connoisseur of cheese but it was pretty good. Honestly I could have made this plate at home. Ok so then we ordered the BBQ Octopus small plate, again another Charlotte Observer favorite suggested by the waitress. The plate was just well weird. The ony octoupus tentacle lacked flavor other than a very burnt grill taste. Not their best dish by far. After that we had the beef carpaccio. My date had never tried it before and it is too bad he tried it here. The beef is supposed to be sliced thinly with olive oil and pepper and salt. This meat was thicker and was covered in horseradish. You could not taste the flavor of the meat at all. We had to scrape the horseradish off the and the fennel they sliced. The other thing is their complimentary bread. It was very dry and again nothing to write home about. Needless to say, I will not be going back. I think if you stick with the large plates you will be ok but their small plates lack flavor and are just weird.",0,0,0,"""Customshop Handcrafted Food""",Elizabeth,"""1601 Elizabeth Ave""",Charlotte,NC,28204,35.2138221,-80.8263692,4.0,176,1,Restaurants;Seafood;American (New)

Well we got the pizza and it looked like the ingredients were tossed on the pizza after it came out of the oven. There was not enough cheese and it tasted like tomato sauce on dough with some veggies. 

The service was also horrible! We ordered delivery after receiving a flyer under our resort room door. When the driver delivered our pizza he told us we were supposed to order Parmesan cheese and crushed peppers when placing the order. When delivering to a hotel\/resort that should be necessary to have some handy, especially when we mention we are staying in a hotel\/resort when placing the order! 

When I called to complain about the pizza and mention the lack of cheese and peppers I had to repeat my complaint to two different people! I'm assuming the manager was the last to speak with me and he was very very rude!! Telling me that they normally don't automatically have cheese and peppers on hand because we were staying at the grand view ""resort"" which are like furnished condos. Any hotel is like a furnished condo, you idiot!! A resort does not differ from a hotel in any way other than their reservations and fees. This guy assumed a resort also meant full stocked fridge and pantry in order to save money on having a driver always carry peppers and cheese??? 

Not to mention, the complaint about the pizza was also not taken lightly! I was told I was the first person to complain about their food in 20 years!! Maybe because their customers are normally already drunk by the time they get their pizza late night and it makes no difference to them. This guy then proceeded to tell me that I could call back in the morning to repeat my complaint to their day manager. I ordered our pizza at 830pm, what good is calling the next morning going to do for our disgusting dinner!! I was told they would not send a driver out 30 miles to deliver us a better pizza. Um, Did he not realize that I could google them and see they were only 8 miles away! And even if they were that far, why would they advertise under our door if they were not willing to drive to us! I have never had such horrible service or food!!

I guess Little Italy Pizza doesn't care about customer service or customer retention because they market to the hotels and resorts which contain people that are only here for a few days at a time! Very very disappointed with this place, if I could I would have flyers placed under each resort\/hotel door with this review of them.

A recent Friday dinner included violet-marinated olives, delicious fresh bread and butter, and an assortment of mains including a beautifully-cooked steak (along with the requisite frites!) and pan-roasted chicken served with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. Flavors were solid and the meal rather tasty, although I thought the flavors of the food did not quite hold up to the promise of the decor (perfectly lovely) and the well-thought out wine list (neither long nor short, but comprehensive). Service was impeccable--my wine glass was never empty--and that is apparently a lot to say about restaurants in this town. Dessert sounded good, but our party was, alas, too sated to be tempted.

All in all, a very good spot, but one that could benefit from some added zing. But then, a typical French bistro meal is quite lovely, too; it's just that it seems dressed up a tad beyond that, but delivers just exactly that.

Well, after grazing dozens of of other buffets (when did they stop being called smorgasbords?) throughout my life I made it to this one last week.Was it the best ever? Nope. It came in second place (first goes to Wheeling Island Casino in West Virginia). But second out of some 50 to 60 buffets is pretty good.

This buffet did all the regular fare that any buffet should do. You know, the ice cream machine, the heaping helpings of shrimp cocktails, the fresh baked breads, the carving stations and the Asian fusion station and pizza platters for the kids (why they're at a casino in Las Vegas I'll never understand, but I digress).

What sets this buffet apart is the extras. The extra selections you don't find elsewhere and the extra steps on the items you expect.

This is the only place I've ever had Steak Tartar at a buffet. The ""peeled and deveined"" shrimp, the Ahi salads, the fresh sushi and a very nice nicoise salad are examples of items that are rare at any buffet but fit in well here. The carving station had Prime Rib that seemed to alternate between Medium Rare and Medium Well with each new roast they brought to the board. A very nice touch. The leg of lamb was very well prepared as well. Also, all the usual accoutrement were available, such as fresh au jus, horseradish sauce, milled mustard and mint jellies. 

The King Crab Legs were a nice size and pre-split but I was somewhat disappointed that they were served cold. Drawn butter was available but it's still not the same, you know?

Though it was a small item I raved about the soft pretzel rolls on the bread bar. A small round puff of Philadelphia soft pretzel flavor was simply the best bread I've ever had. Somehow I kept nibbling on this item all night long.;)

As is the case with every buffet (and I mean every one) the dessert course was easily the least impressive. With 5 of us at the table we managed to get a sample of every dessert offered and only 3 items got a thumbs up from the table mates. My favorite was the chocolate raspberry cone but others liked the key lime tort and chocolate mousse cake.
We went at 7 p.m. on a Wednesday night and walked right in. Service was fine and the atmosphere was passable but don't go for those reasons.

I could not decide which one I wanted to try and finally reluctantly chose 1. She came back in a few minutes with both flavors and offered to give me 2 of them and only charge for 1.

-love the look of this restaurant. It's very a cozy and romantic feeling with the dimmed lights. 


SERVICE:
-Our waiter was too busy to greet us so another waitress had to ask us what drinks we wanted and to take our order (which also took a long time). 

-When our actual waiter introduced himself he was friendly but seemed rushed. 

-The wait for our food was another long wait, around 30 mins or so. 

-I had to ask for guacamole on three separate occasions as the waiter forgot to bring it. 

-We had to ask for our dessert twice as he also forgot to bring that as well. And the wait for our dessert was another 30 mins!!!! 

-Overall service was pretty crappy and slow! I understand that wait times on weekends are expected to be longer than usual but this was excessive. Hire more staff to work for busy times! 


FOOD:
-Food was excellent! We got the nachos and bruschetta, both extremely delicious. For dessert we got the white chocolate brownie which is always to die for.

That being said, it was time to explore a new Mexican joint around UNLV, seeing as I've been to all of them around campus. 

I'd passed by many times and was curious about trying it out. While standing a mere 15 feet from the door, I did a quick check on Yelp and it was done, I was definitely going to check it out today (6\/9\/11.)

Walking inside, you're met by a cute beachy interior. It's laid back, but doesn't feel dirty. I didn't know what to order, and just went with the suggested 3 tacos for $4.99.  I had the chicken, shrimp and fish topped with cabbage and pico de gallo. There's something so fun about eating little corn tortilla tacos, and the ones at Baja are no exception. 

The fish, well, I hate fish, but these, these were really good! (Yeah, I'll order things I think I hate, just to see if I'll like it if it is prepared in a different way.) The shrimp were good (and there is no upcharge!) and the chicken, well, that was the best one. For some reason, the seasoning on the chicken, mixed with the cabbage on top reminded me of the flavors of moo shu and hoisin sauce. 

The owner and chef were very friendly and we chatted while I ate and went over my anatomy & physiology book. It's not often that you find staff that are both cool and interesting to talk with - where it's not forced (I've felt trapped at some restaurants when I've gotten stuck talking with owners.) They're chill and were nice enough to make and serve me a deep fried Oreo, on the house! I'd never had a deep fried Oreo, and I'm one of the few people on earth that can pass on Oreos, but this was good! It tasted like warm cake and I'd suggest giving it a try if you've never eaten one. 

It really surprises me that there weren'ta ton of people eating in here (I came after it had been open 20 minutes so maybe that's why) - the food here is much better than anything on campus (and better than much that's around campus as well!)

I would highly caution anyone from contracting with CertaPro Painters of Southern Nevada.  My wife and I recently had a very dissatisfying experience with this company\/franchise in relation to having the interior of my Henderson home painted.
The actual work was satisfactory (and honestly I'd probably described it as above-average), but after I inspected the work and paid the supervisor who was present during the 4-day project I received a call from their receptionist, of all people, 2 days later telling me there was a $700 upcharge related to an item which frankly was specifically included in my contract.  After multiple conversations (including with the franchise owner) where the reason for the upcharge was described to me, I in turn read the contract word-for-word to each of the people I spoke with (again, up to and including the franchise owner) whereby it specified those tasks were included in the already paid amount.  After much frustration for my wife and I, including another scheduled job from this company which they cancelled day-of due to ""refusal to make full payment on the previous job"", their franchise owner agreed to waive the upcharge despite his continued insistence that he felt it was valid.  Additionally no apology was given to my wife and I, nor justification provided for our side of the story (which the contract supported).  This included no apology for the circumstances in which our other scheduled job was cancelled by them last minute.  Interestingly enough, this franchise's homepage has a Mission Statement from the very owner who found it so difficult to honor the letter of our contract.  In this Mission Statement he says his franchise's first core value is to ""delivers what you promise.""  My wife and I found this to NOT be the case in the least.
If you do choose to contract with this company, I would say make 100% sure everything is crystal clear.  Although, I'm not sure given our experience it would make any difference.  So maybe it's best to just utilize one of the many other paint contractors here in Las Vegas and avoid the potential headache.",3,0,0,"""CertaPro Painters of Southern Nevada""",,"""1000 N Green Valley Pkwy, Ste 440-332""",Henderson,NV,89074,36.0280249,-115.0840816,4.5,12,1,Home Services;Painters;Contractors

If you're looking for a good selection of non name brand items with a healthier twist, then this is your grocery store.

You will only find a few select brands throughout the store & most of the time it's Traders Joe's private label brand. This is a good thing though, as most of the stuff is more unique then you'd find in your large supermarkets, & most of the stuff is a healthier option. The store is relatively small though, so don't expect a huge selection of items, especially in the frozen & chilled sections. But you'll find some unique items here & wonder why you haven't seen these items before.

And if you like wine, then you must make a trip here. They have a huge selection of wines, but the main wine attraction is their ""2 buck Chuck"", which is actually $3 here. It's their signature wine & can only be found at Trader Joe's. They have around 4-5 varieties of their signature wine & it has been voted best wine for the price numerous times.

The rooms were clean and I didn't have the same issue of hearing other people's noise, as some reviews mentioned. Beds were soft and comfy. The size of the rooms and bathrooms were really good compared to other hotels. There is one small bathroom when you walk in, then a good sized living room with a desk, couch, chair, tv and table. The bedroom had plenty of space and the main bathroom had 2 sinks, a shower, bathtub, and enclosed toilet. I wasn't there long so I didn't use the shower but my friends said the water kept switching from hot to cold. When we requested extra towels they were brought up within 10 minutes. 

THE Hotel is connected to Mandalay Bay so you share the casino and all of their pool facilities. There is a somewhat lengthy walk to get to the pools. I wanted to float in the lazy river but couldn't bring myself to spend $22 on a floating tube. The wave pool dispenses one small wave every 90 seconds. So, not too exciting. There is a topless pool for adults and Daylight Beach club. The good thing is if you're going to LIGHT nightclub, the entrance is so close to THE Hotel!

The best meat dishes to get would be the grilled pork and the mackerel. We have tried the bulgogi and spicy squid and pork. The beef bulgogi is okay but the spicy squid and pork is quite spicy for our palette. The plate of lettuce wraps also comes with a variety of leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, cabbage and kale with some other pickled leafy greens and fresh herbs. Their pork bone soup for 2 people is quite worth it and lots of pork bone for more than 2 people.

After insurmountable amount of time waiting, we finally got our appetizer (Seriously, how long does it take to put some already cooked chicken in sauce and then place it on lettuce wraps?). The chicken and lettuce wraps were a little too heavily marinated, and I had to brush off the sauce from the chicken in order to avoid sodium overload.
 
The vegetable sushi roll was humongous!  It was twice the size of the usual sushi I get from Japanese restaurants.  But it was absolutely delicious: crisp, juicy, and generous in amount, the vegetables really danced in my mouth.  This was definitely the highlight of the meal.  A five would be given just for this portion.

We also got the smoked salmon roll, which was equally as big.  The glob of mediocre cream cheese really did hinder the flavor from the surprisingly fresh salmon.  The kiwi on top of the roll worked, but there was overall a lack of flavor on behalf of the whole roll.

This review is passenger based since I do not know enough about the trails and tribulations associated with being a driver arriving for passenger pick up or short term parking

The airport facilities are very clean, modern looking, and inviting.  Signs for maneuvering through the airport are easy to follow.  If one is unsure of their destination, a staff member will guide you in a friendly manner.

Prices for food and drinks are affordable and in line with other dining spots away from airport property.  The only comment I have, is in regards to the hours of operation for these establishments. I am not sure what dictates these hours, but most of the places were closed, or closing, before 9pm during my last visit. So many travelers were trying to find a place to dine without much luck.

A great place for a fun night out.  Be it an intimate dinner for two or for a large group like our entire office, the Melting Pot is a fun and delicious way to spend an evening.  Honestly, even at a bare minimum, expect to spend at least three hours there.

We went for one of the the pre-made combinations called ""The Big Night Out"", since it had everything that we wanted. Filets\/Duck\/Lobster YUM

The combinations consist of three courses.

- The Appetizers - a selection of fresh veggies, breads and cheeses with your choice of fondue using a variety of cheeses.  Cheese on Cheese... it's such a delicious crime YUM

-The main course - Consisting of fresh meats(Filets, Chicken, Duck) and possibly seafood(Lobster, Shrimp, etc) depending on which combo you ordered. And your choice of stock.  We went for the coq au vin which is chicken broth with scallions, red wine, etc.

-Desserts - We went for the Yin Yang, which is a variety of brownies,marshmallows (Graham Covered\/Oreo Covered) and fruits.  The best part is the fondue consisting of white and dark chocolate arranged into a Yin\/Yang symbol.  Awesome presentation.

Our server was extremely helpful as this was our first visit and patiently and humorously explained everything to us.

One thing that made my eyebrow raise though is the fact that they charged us the full adult price for my 8 year old nephew.   So just be aware of this if you are planning on bringing kids.

If I recall correctly the combos are about 75$

- Reservations are HIGHLY recommended.  As mentioned earlier,  dinner here takes a few hours, so they can only serve a few groups per night.

- This place is always a great date idea if you want some guaranteed quality time toget to know your partner. (Just make sure you can entertain her\/him for the entire 3 hours or else it'll be torture)

- To complement the Yin\/Yang dessert, they also have a Chocolate Martini that is also presented in Yin\/Yang fashion.",2,0,0,"""The Melting Pot - Las Vegas""",Westside,"""8704 W Charleston Blvd""",Las Vegas,NV,89117,36.1594276731,-115.285243605,4.0,259,1,Fondue;Restaurants

 Ich hatte die guten Bewertungen auf qype gelesen und wollte den Schellenturm schon lange mal ausprobieren. Hatte mich daher auch auf den Abend gefreut - leider wurde ich total enttäuscht.


 Das Ambiente ist nett, der Turm gemütlich - fing daher alles ganz vielversprechend an.


 aber dann:
Der Service war plump, unprofessionell und einfach völlig daneben. Das jeder Gast geduzt wird und die Beratung eher ein Aufdrängen von manchen Getränken\/Speisen ist - ok, wäre nicht so schlimm gewesen.


 Wir sind ja in einer bodenständigen, urigen Weinstube mit schwäbischen Spezialitäten...
Der hoch angepriesene Aperitif war allerdings schrecklich, die Weinempfehlung war daneben und leider, leider war das Essen auch einfach nicht gut! Der Salat war naja, die Beilagen zum Hauptgang fad und das Fleisch weder auf den Punkt noch auf irgendeine Art und Weise raffiniert. Die 'Kräuterkruste' war ziemlich geschmacklos und ich hatte immer das Gefühl von Sand zwischen den Zähnen.


 Leider brachte mir die Bedienung auch noch die falsche Beilage zum Hauptgang. Reklamieren ging nicht, da sie sich dann die nächste halbe Stunde nicht mehr blicken ließ.


 Mein Fehler, dass ich zu lange auf die Rückkehr gewartet hatte, das Essen wurde dazu nämlich auch noch kalt. Ich ließ daher meinen Teller fast unberührt komplett zurückgehen. Eine Entschuldigung für die falsche Beilage habe ich bekommen - allerdings nicht für den nicht vorhandenen Service. Dafür kam ich in den Genuß einer lautstarken Belehrung, dass an meinem Essen nichts auszusetzen sei und viele Gäste anstandslos das Gericht gegessen hätten. Na dann.


 Ach ja, der Preis wurde voll berechnet.


 Fazit: Kantinen-Essen Niveau für einen dafür unverschämten Preis.


 Ich gehe so oft essen. Sehr gerne und häufig in Stuttgart. Spontan würden mir mindestens 10 wirklich gute und gemütliche Weinstuben einfallen, in denen ich noch nie irgendetwas auszusetzen hatte und die ich gerne weiterempfehle.

For me true Chicago Pizza is Giodrano's, Lou Malnati's and Gino's East. It is difficult to find true Chicago pizza outside of Chicago. Amore does a good job with their pizza though, especially if you can't travel all the way to Chicago!

The stuffed pizza is huge and heavy. The outer crust is about 2.5 inches thick (or should I say tall), nice and crispy, the bottom crust is relatively thin and chewy but manages to hold all the ingredients. There's plenty of cheese and all the other toppings tasted fresh. Their sausage is particularly good, having a nice sweet taste of fennel. The sauce has a nice chunky texture and balances sweetness and tanginess pretty well. The pizza is greasy, at least if it has sausage (due to the huge size and amount of toppings) but also very satisfying, believe me if you are hungry and think you can easily eat a normal 14"" pizza, you'll probably only be able to eat half of the 14"" Amore pie.

Note if you order a stuffed pizza to eat in or take out, the pie takes 45 mins to cook.

The indoors sitting area is decorated with all sorts of pictures and memorabilia from Chicago, overall pretty clean and good service.

If you want Chicago pizza in Las Vegas, Amore is probably the only real choice (along with Rosati's maybe, and I'd say Pietown but it's closed for now). Their pizza is big, has plenty of toppings and is very satisfying. It's the next best thing if you can't travel all the way to Chicago.",15,0,4,"""Amore Taste of Chicago""",Spring Valley,"""3945 S Durango Dr""",Las Vegas,NV,89147,36.1191125,-115.2797333,4.0,617,1,Italian;Restaurants;Pizza

I have been visiting Lawry's Prime Rib for years now and this is by far, my favorite place to get the prime rib. The Beverly Hills location will always be considered home for me, but it was nice to eat here at the Vegas location while visiting for EDC. 

Taylor was my server and she was really sweet. She made many great suggestions, but I know that the prime rib will always win my heart. 

I love the chilled spinning salad because it's cold and different. The salad is in a metal bowl sitting in a bath of ice. Taylor gives it a big spin and while its spinning, she pours in the dressing. 

As for the prime rib, it's really amazing to see the chef come by in his gigantic oven-like cooker! You just tell him exactly what cut you want, how much you like it cooked, and if you want any sides. I always get the California cut, cooked close to medium rare, along with a side of mash potatoes and creamed corn. To top that off, you also get the amazing bread pudding and horse radish to eat your prime rib with.

My boyfriend ordered the lobster tail with the filet mignon steak and was a bit disappointed. Not because it didn't taste good, but because the prime rib tasted better.

On our continuation of exploring Sunday brunch places, we put our names in at the South Park location (sits in that little circle of restaurants off the beaten path) and were told 45 minutes, which we were expecting. We wandered over to Cast Iron Waffles (also on the list) and checked out the menu there, just to be gluttons for punishment and torture our already-rumbling stomachs.

Anyways, after about a half hour, we were seated. Gorgeous interior, two stories and wicked high ceilings. After deliberation and compromise, I decided that I was going to get the Lemon Poppyseed French Toast, while the Lady would order the Banana Pecan French Toast.

Bad decision.

The lemon poppyseed toast was out of this world! It was super moist and had an incredible flavor, and the berries that went with it were a fantastic compliment. The banana pecan was good, don't get my wrong. But wowww. 

I was in a group of 6 and I don't think there was a single complaint. The benedicts looked wonderful, chicken and waffles was a really generous portion.

The dish came with a generous serving of white rice along with some Chinese broccoli on the side and hoison and sweet & sour sauces to dip in.  Absolutely loved it.  Good portions.  Tasty food.  Why haven't I came here sooner?

My wife ordered the Beef Chow Fun (no gravy, dry) which was very good as well.  The beef were sized pretty well and the taste was spot on.   The portions were a good size and it was enough for the two of us.  

Service was fast.  Food came out fast.  I'll come back again real soon and I'll hope to try the soups in addition to that mouth-watering pork and roast duck.

This was my first time at the Port Credit location. This one is a touch smaller than some of the others I've visited but with several sections as well as a great summer friendly patio there is no shortage of seating.

No issues with service and pricing as it's what I've come to expect from this company and it's fair and consistent.

I think my issues today lay with the quality of the burger. With so many varieties I feel like it's difficult for the kitchen to perfect any one burger truly well. My biggest pet peeve is a dry burger patty and even after making that clear today it's exactly what I got. I was told that the burgers are cooked to a standard medium well, and there is no variance on this unless you want it cooked more. The server assured me that even at that temperature it was going to be a super juicy burger - it wasn't sadly. Charred and bone dry inside. 

The burger was the  Gettin' Piggy With it, which is on their Top Ten list, so maybe I expected more? 

I don't think this is true of the brand as I've been to the Brampton and Toronto locations and always had an exceptional burger experience. This one was actually a hard sell for me and required a lot of ketchup to get down. 

Why did I not send it back? Well given what the server said to start I figured that this wouldn't change based on who was cooking it and how they are required to cook it and I was too hungry and in too much of a rush to wait for a fresh burger with potentially the same result.

I'm definitely not writing them off because as I said, I know they make quality products (like the onion rings I had today with my burger - awesome!).

I'll try them again and see if anything changes

Sometimes the icing is combination of buttercream and cream cheese and have to add an awful amount of icing sugar. That being said the reason I like this place is their cupcakes are more flavorful and a lot less sweet. My favorite is the pumpkin cupcake the cake is made with pumpkin purée and spices kind of like a spice cake moist and not dense. The buttercream is lighter than regular type it might a combination of butter cream and whipped cream so it's not too rich and heavy.  The pumpkin white chocolate chip cookies are wonderful they are cake like cookies, soft and chewy with a good hint of spices and also pumpkin purée in the cookies.

But, the owner told me that the one he buys his beef from actually gives them a little corn near the end of their feeding period.

First impressions was a fairly large, stand-alone restaurant, large parking lot so they can accommodate a lot of folks (well cars and then folks inside).

We were pretty early (11:30 am) so it was a bit sparse inside as far as the lunch crowd, but as we were waiting\/eating our meal, the booths and tables started filling up.

Our server was very nice and had a lot of recommendations.  The menu is really simple, but there are a lot of options and really you can customize your meal to how you want it (very accommodating).  As you wait on your meal to arrive, a basket of hush puppies are delivered to your table with butter.  They aren't the typical ""large"" hush puppies, more like bites and they are pretty addictive.  WARNING:  most likely you will get hush puppies with your meal also, but it's a good thing!

I tried the salt & pepper catfish.... and when it came out it was a mountain of food!  I opted to have a half & half fries and onion rings combo... Everything was cooked right.... (you can't really mess up fried food too badly)  but it was just WAY too much food.

To top it all off, the restaurant manager sent out a honking slice of dessert (they were trying out) to the first few lunch tables of the day.  IT was a strawberry shortcake.  Very good - not too sweet and a good way to end an already ginormous food outing.

The interior is nice, very dim and dark with fake candles throughout. However the room we were in kept having flickering issues on the fake chandelier which was a bit annoying.   Sinatra playing loudly on the speakers an appropriate choice no doubt for the theme of the resto.

Service was good, Kirk the server was affable, friendly and prompt. 

Wine by the glass was pleasantly affordable, multiple choices at $7 per glass 

Food is where I had to take some points away. Salads and appetizers are way too expensive IMO.  No salad was under $10 with many several dollars more. No homemade caesar salad on the menu is a borderline sin for a pizza place. Appetizers suffer the same pitfall, all $12 or more. 

Our grilled octopus app was a very small portion for the price, and a bit fishy tasting. Definitely not worth the price; see attached photos

Margherita pizza, I consider myself well versed in them. I order them EVERYWHERE I go, when offered. The one at Goodfellas had way too thick of a crust near the edges, which meant the thinner parts of the pizza were bitter with charring. The cheese was great, sauce was good but sparse. 

Wife's Taglietele al Funghi was delicious but very heavy. Very small portion again, but rich. Lots of delicious mushroom flavour.  Pasta nicely cooked, al dente. 

Long story short :  some hits, some misses with the food. Most items strike me as overpriced for the portions.

It's a huge complex, but at least where we are it's exceptionally quiet (we barely hear anyone, ever, and I work from home).  The ladies in the front office have been courteous and outgoing every time we've spoken.  They called today just to see how we've been doing since we moved in, and then walked over to our unit and gave us a free pizza to show their appreciation.  I've never lived anywhere that did anything that...it's certainly a nice gesture.  They also do other things like last weekend they had a cookout by the pool with free hot dogs, and they always have free popsicles in the main office.  We've had two minor service requests since we've lived here (one issue with a toilet and another with a light).  In both cases the service person was here the very next day to fix the issues, and he was very nice.

When we considered renting here, we read the Yelp reviews which seem rather mixed.  But we visited in person and used our judgment based on reviews but also our initial impression.  Some of the negative reviews maybe we just haven't experienced (noise, etc.) or it's possible some people tend to complain more than others.  For example, the person complaining about one gate entrance at night...is this really the biggest problem in your life, that you have to drive an extra half a block to get in after 6:00 p.m. in order for us to have better nighttime security at the complex?

Service: 3 - The restaurant wasn't that filled, so it was fast for them to take our orders and bring out the food.

I didn't stay in the room but did go up to it and thought it was perfect.  They had a two bedroom suite with a full size kitchen which made it easy for them to fill the fridge with a ton of food and drink so they were able to economize on that aspect of their stay (which left more money for nice dinners, Chippendales, a spa treatment, etc., etc.).  And, speaking of economizing, the room rate was GREAT!  I had originally booked it about three months in advance but when I checked back about a month later the rate had decreased......no problem, the reservationist changed it and gave us the better rate.  But wait, another month later I checked the rate and it had gone down even more....no problem, the reservationist changed it again :-)

When I picked up the girls I asked what they thought of the place and they all said they would definitely stay there again and they couldn't think of one thing to complain about.

On a side note, I drove them there in a 23 foot motorhome and parked it offsite so I can't comment on the parking.  However, I was able to pull into the front entrance area to drop off and pick them up without any problem.  Just make sure the whole party is present outside before you attempt this as they don't like an oversized vehicle loitering around that area for too long (understandably).

On another side note, if you're going with a big group (such a a bachelorette party) the motorhome was awesome!  The girls were able to party on the way there and sleep it off on the way back, they all loved it and the trip was a blast for everyone....even Mr. Stud the blow up doll.....haha!!!!",5,3,1,"""Elara by Hilton Grand Vacations""",The Strip,"""80 E Harmon Ave""",Las Vegas,NV,89109,36.1084415,-115.1691841,3.5,823,1,Event Planning & Services;Hotels & Travel;Vacation Rentals;Hotels

EA5pJMkmv1eclqcpQ9Bq0Q,dDIOnbF-QdEPg6MbXM4iaA,FPunXW5NBaTKgx5uBrdD5g,2010-05-30,"I'd like to warn others to stay away from King and Mane. It will ease the sting of having wasted my time and money and taste buds there myself. It's overpriced bar-quality food at best, along with very lackluster service.

Can you imagine going to a restaurant and putting your entree orders in, only to be told about 35 minutes later that they are out of your entree for the night? It' can happen to you if you go to ""King and Mane.""

The way to deal with this is to NOT order a different entree when they ask what else you'd like instead - if they can't get it together to notify you, if not WHEN you place the order, then within 10 minutes thereafter MAX that the kitchen is unable to fulfill this request - then they do NOT deserve any more of your business than what you have already had to give them just by being there and ordering what you have already reluctantly eaten.

We waited about an hour for our food, during which time no less than 3 different server changes were made on us mid-meal. We could never tell who was coming or going. When they did come to the table they failed to notice or address basic things like an empty beer bottle, and thus would have to be actively hailed down to request another drink. I don't normally drink the ice water served at restaurants but these are the sort of servers who would fail to ever refill your water glass.

They claim to be a gastro-cantina and that there is some sort of a Latin influence to the food, however it is just midwest bland bar food, with an inflated price. The only passable part of the meal was the Beet Salad with manchego and pistachios, however this came oddly accompanied with the only ""Latin"" thing the restaurant apparently offered (a pair of ""soft tortillas"" that were so dry and stale they could slice a jugular) Who is going to wrap this salad in these? Is the inclusion of the tortillas just there to justify the word ""cantina?""

A side of broccoli was ordered that the menu describes as ""sauteed broccoli"" - one of the servers who took the order for this was specifically told by us that we do not like overcooked broccoli and she assured us that it would come out crisp and good. Sure enough, it was brought out (by a different server) as a disgustingly overcooked slop, but also drowning is a yellow puddle of cheap oil. It looked as if it had been boiled for an hour in water, drained, and then doused in a cheap corn oil from a huge tin can. Truly disgusting broccoli! Any chef knows how to do broccoli properly and any kitchen that sends obviously overcooked broccoli out to its customers is run by a poor chef, if he is even present. No one enjoys overcooked broccoli - it not like meats where there a range of acceptable doneness. In fact, if you are at a restaurant that has not yet proven itself to you to be good (EVEN if you have read a ""good"" review in Isthmus) and first order just a side of broccoli and (if you like) specify it to not be overcooked - and if they bring it out overcooked - refuse it and leave. The harder test is to not specify how it to be cooked - they should still bring it out NOT in an overcooked state - they should not have to be told this. The kitchen's missteps are only beginning there and you can get out without any investment this way. This should not be necessary but unfortunately in MADISON it is.

The Sea Scallops entree - which came out shortly after it was announced that the other requested entree was unavailable, leaving one person sitting eating an entree and the other unable to - was nothing special and was served only slightly above room temperature.

The ""Duck Fat Potato Pancake"" which one of the servers assured us would be good, was flavorless (I like to say ""flavor-free"") and to be honest seemed sodium-free.

The service from the three different young women was rushed, indifferent and included outright lies about the food, assuring us of things the kitchen could not or would not deliver on.

AVOID ""King and Mane"" (dumb name too) AT ALL COSTS or you will feel like banging your head on the loud approximately 2'x5' metal plate on the sidewalk next to King and Mane's outdoor seating that every passerby and the waitstaff clanks across if you are trying to eat outside.",6,0,0,"""King and Mane""",Capitol,"""102 King St""",Madison,WI,53703,43.0747301,-89.3815378,2.5,12,0,American (Traditional);Restaurants;Tapas/Small Plates

Easily the best doughnut in Toronto.

And easily the best doughnut in Canada.

As for the best in North America, well for that, it's all up to New York City. You need to go to NYC, and try Doughnut Plant, Dough, Dun-Well, and a few others, and then compare directly to Von.

I think by some yardsticks, Von Doughnuts is the overall winner. By others, it's right up there close behind NYC. But whichever way you look at it, Von Doughnuts is the absolute creme-de-la-creme, no pun intended, OK, pun intended, of Doughnuts.

Paul himself greeted us when my family arrived shortly before the show and helped us get seats just a few feet from where he was performing. What followed was a combination mentalist and close-up magic act which absolutely astounded. Paul has a likable and unpretentious manner, but his skills were incredible. Despite sitting little more than an arm's length away (and from a slightly elevated position which allowed me to look right inside his suit jacket when he waved his hands) Paul performed effects which I'm scratching my head over days later. All the more incredibly, Paul's a terrific guy, and the entire show was put on free. There wasn't even a DVD for sale, although I'd have happily bought one, if only to be able to replay the action in a likely-vain hope of discovering how a couple of the effects were achieved.

We preferred their menu over Bouchon so decided it give it a try. I loved the food selection, the service was great, food itself was delicious. Started with the steak tartar with poached egg. The meat was seasoned perfectly and the poached egg took it to another level. My only criticism would be the bread that was served with the tartar. It was big and bulky. Too much bread to eat with such a delicate tasting dish. Also had the caesar and beet salads. Our mains were the short rib and Scottish salmon. Salmon skin was crispy and the salmon was moist. The short rib was so tender. Would definitely recommend and come back to this place.

Jack Astor's is a Canadian restaurant chain with branches in Canada and New York City. They are specialized on pub food with an international touch, which you can enjoy in a casual atmosphere. 

The branch close to St. Lawrence Market has an outside patio, large bar and restaurant area. They serve local and Canadian brews and have a quite attentive and friendly staff.

I really liked the music they played, which can be described as mainstream rock & pop and the laidback vibe.

Though the menu offers good fish, wok creations and steak dishes I went for the Smoky Jack's burger with their house salad and was not disappointed. The burger was juicy and the salad crisp, just what I needed after a long day of sightseeing.

As mentioned before they serve local brews such as Mill Street Brewery and Hop City. Try the Barking Squirrel Lager (Hop City), which is more like a red ale and very drinkable.

I noticed all the stars on yelp for precision plumbing so I called for an estimate on a Sunday morning and the nice lady on the phone said the plumber could be there within an hour. I was soooo happy about that. Jason Simon was our plumber, he is a wonderful man. He looked at our old one and gave us an estimate to install our new one. He NEVER once tried to up sell us, he never said we had to buy extra things or that other things had to be done, he also didn't say bad things about a store bought water heater ( just to sell a higher price one to us). Times are tough and we just had an estimate before Jason came, that plumber only wanted for us to buy a new unit from his company, told us the one we bought wasn't good quality and there were so many things wrong that he would have to cut holes in our walls to the outside of our home. ( I don't know if I am allowed to say the other company's name,but I will say the stars on yelp don't lie. They only have 1) I was really afraid about this whole process  and how much it was really going to cost. When Jason did come and do the estimate, he had a price sheet and gave us a price. We felt the price was right and to tell the truth I trusted him. They are not overpriced.  I am VERY satisfied compared to the other estimate. He did the install right away and now I have hot water again. I really want to thank him and the company for getting the job done well and quick even on a weekend.

I had to talk to three people there to have my blood test results sent to my old doctor, finally after being told by two people previously that they would send them, Amber in the billing department finally helped me, it turned out that I had to sign something which neither of the two people before her mentioned.

Even though they have family times in the pool area, the locker rooms are restricted to those 14 years of age or older. This means no whining, sniveling brats underfoot when you're trying to wind down after a long, hard workout. This alone is worth the price of membership.

I love the deco, the ambiance, the service (it was lacking in the beginning, but after I complained then all good from then on), the quantity, but the quality of the food was very disappointing! 

Sushi Dinner 1 ($17.95) 
- 9 pieces of nigiri and a choice of either Spicy Tuna\/Salmon 
- the fish was not too fresh...and was slice really thin and each sushi made with huge ball of rice 
- no wasabi at all in any sushi... I know some Japanese restaurant will ask if you prefer not to (Mikado does that) but Sushi Bar is one of the first one that I been to that does not put any wasabi inside. 
- the Tuna Spicy roll was just so so.. the spiciness is really from the spicy mayo on top... 
- The shari rice was not made properly, as I notice it really lack the taste of rice vinegar... 

I do like the nice touch that my meal came with a lot of appetizers: soup with tempura bits and noodle, edamane, pickled bean sprouts and teriyaki tofu. And an ice cream to finish off...

It is a bit pricier, but the quality can't be beat compared to other local restos! I've brought many friends here and they agree! 

The sashimi is very fresh and literally, melts in your mouth. The rolls comes in pretty large portions. and are presented in an appealing fashion. My favourites rolls: are rainbow, spicy salmon, and spider. Their noodle dishes are very good too.

I had no idea that the scenery changed every 20 minutes. It was a clever trick that screams Vegas, baby! In an upscale, sophisticated way, I suppose. The walls rise up or are taken down, the ceiling flips closed or turns inward and opens. The music blares and the lights dim or brighten while the action is in progress. It's a fun little show. 

The food is overpriced, but what do you expect in the Wynn? I've read other reviews that speculated Switch has a 10-20% premium and I'd tend to agree. That said, I was lucky on this particular night and was seated quickly considering I arrived with no reservation. The wait staff was courteous and helpful. 

I decided to try the Bison Steak for my entree. I asked for medium rare and they delivered, slightly bloody as expected. The meat was lean and juicy. Not as juicy as a normal steak, but bison is different from beef and I expected as much. The fat content is far lower than normal beef. They also had a port glaze sauce which I enjoyed. As a side I ordered the potato gratin. The top was crispy, herbed and appropriately salted. The potato underneath was creamy and cooked just enough. The combination was delicious and satisfying. 

That day they had a Seafood Soup special that was comprised of a tomato based broth, shrimp, salmon and a few mussels. The broth was tasty and the seafood fresh. It had a nice balance and there was a surprising amount of salmon in the soup. 

I paired this with a nice bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay. 

All in all, it was a clever, fun environment with the ""switches"", the view of the pool area and the overall ambiance. I can't complain about the food because it was a nice meal, but somehow I was expecting more. The dishes didn't have the pop, pizazz or unexpected flavors or contrasts I'd expect from such a high end location. That said, it's a steak house. Not a gourmet fusion french\/asian wonderland, so I should keep my expectations in check. However, what's the point of a review without a few nits to pick.

You can see some of the communication barrier is a challenge for both the tech and the customer especially if someone is in a hurry.

There are many options to choose from, several of which are made as you wait.  I chose to order a tofu and veggie noodle dish from the booth aptly named, ""Noodles"".  The cook tossed some veggies and tofu in a hot pan and began sauteeing them.  He asked if I wanted them spicy and I said ""Yes"".  He put some noodles on a plate and poured the contents of the pan over them.  When he handed me the plate, it looked tasty and hot.  I grabbed a bottle of water and paid $11.25, which I found to be pricey.

When I tried a bite of the noodles, I couldn't get my fork through them.  For a moment, I was bewildered.  I thought, ""why can't I penetrate this noodle fortress?""  Well, it's because they were hard and stuck together.  I had to use a knife to cut through them and it still wasn't easy to separate them.  I guess this is how the dish is served, but I prefer my noodles cooked, hot, and soft, which these were not.  The noodles were crunchy, but there was no indication of this on the menu that I recall.  Anyway, it was tasty, but I won't order them again.

In Vegas, there are so many wonderful spas to chose from. This, however, just happened to be inside our hotel....so, convenience was key.

Bottom line: Gooooo here. Get your massage, spend some time in the steam room, take a dip in the hot tub, & shnooze like a baby (suck your thumb in fetal position if you have to even) for a few hours on their lounge chair!!!

If you haven't been before it can seem a little confusing and crowded. Calm down. Nudge your way in and order a drink from the bartender that never forgets. Rail drinks are about $3.50 a piece ($3.75 for an old fashioned) ridiculously reasonable. They also have a surprisingly good selection of beer and wine. (If you need menus ask while ordering your drink.) Find a waitress and place your order. Find a place to kick it for at least the next hour - that sometimes means hovering if you are looking for a place to sit. 

When your table is ready your waitress will seat you. Salads, relish, and bread will all be waiting. I love the classic aspect of a relish tray. The dressings have that old style taste to them so keep that in mind when ordering (a la not Kraft.) Almost as soon as you can finish your salad a very hot portion of fish will brought to you. My dining partner got the baby pike with a baked potato and I had the cod with French fries - we shared everything. The pike was super delicious, a mild fish taste with a very light breading. The cod was flakey and coated and fried up marvelously - a perfect brown. The baked potato was absolutely huge and came with a solid helping of sour cream. The French fries are flat cut and fried up nice and golden. Far better than your typical restaurant fries - they could have used a little more salt for my taste but that's why there is a shaker on the table. At the end of the meal you also get a sweet treat.

Located up in North NORTH town up in the quiet community of Providence, Divine Eatery is situated right in front of an apartment complex and a smattering of mostly local businesses. 

VEGGIE BURRITO ($10.95): Kind of pricey for a breakfast burrito, especially because there's no side! I wish there was more potatoes and that they were crispier. If there's such a thing as scrambled eggs being too moist, yup, that happened. The burrito was just okay. I would order something different next time - maybe pancakes! 3\/5

STEAK MELT SANDWICH ($10.95): My husband opted for lunch instead. He LOVED his sandwich and raved that the meat was ""the good stuff"", i.e., not fatty. He also upgraded the fries to garlic fries for an extra $1. The fries were great! Super fresh! 4.5\/5

SERVICE: The server was pleasant and the chef\/owner was warm and friendly. Even though we came in 30 minutes before closing, the server didn't rush us at all and told us to take our time. Our server also sent us off with a to-go cup of a fountain drink ($2). Thanks! Cuz we thirsty! The chef chatted with us and told us how she used to work in the casinos and opened up her own restaurant for a more ideal work schedule. 4\/5

ATMOSPHERE: Tables and chairs are mismatched and the cafe is pretty small. The walls are lined with artwork from local artists available for purchase. Music (from the chef's Ipod?) plays in the background. 3\/5   

Return Visit?
I'd come back sometime in the future.

In the same plaza, there's a bar. What goes better than beers and sandwiches? Clever, clever marketing.

It's lunchtime and I've heard great things about this place from yelp. I had a feeling this place wouldn't disappoint.

My boyfriend and I ordered the falafel and the chicken club sandwiches, then split to share. Ranging from $3-$9, this is a perfect affordable lunch spot. 

There is some seating available, but I think there's only one table and a few other chairs. Great place to grab something on-the-go! 

You have a choice of white, wheat, or rye bread. There's also add-ons like fried egg ($1), chip bits ($0.50), cheese ($1), crisp chicken skin ($2), bacon ($2), and foie gras mousse ($4). I should have added chip bits to mine!

Falafel: kale slaw, cucumber, and chickpea puree between two slices of bread.
Kale slaw wasn't bitter, perfectly wilted, and worked well with the cucumber for that crispy crunch. The chickpea puree in it tied it all together. Slightly chunky and dripping with just the right amount of dill sauce (I think), it was an explosion of flavor and quite filling. Delicious.

Chicken Club: Soft chicken bits mixed with wilted veggies, provolone, bacon, tomato, and ginger. Amazing. So tasty that I'd want my boyfriend to propose to me on the spot in the backdrop of Goodwich with me cramming this sandwich into my mouth. Greasy sandwich but oh so worth it. The flavor combination was incredible. Savory, muted sweetness from the cheese, and the fresh veggies balance it out. Also filling. The ginger wasn't overpowering and complemented the other ingredients well. 

It didn't feel like there was needless ingredient in the sandwiches. All of it ""made sense."" Even their assortment of some unique sodas and chips that you wouldn't find at the grocery store was a cool touch.

The owner actually took our order. He was funny, entertaining, and incredibly patient in answering all of our questions about the menu. Listening to him talk about old Las Vegas and his Vegas-native roots was cool. While we were waiting for our sandwiches, he kept thanking us for our patience and letting us know the status of our order when it wasn't even a long wait at all! We got a sense that he truly appreciated our business and us being there. Love his '50s old-Vegas style he's got going on. 

Everything from the ingredients; the carefully wrapped wax paper with the Goodwich sticker stamped on it; and the white paper bag with the logo was well-thought out. They really put so much effort into the stand's theme. It made me feel this place is one-of-a-kind, memorable. 

The whole concept of Goodwich is something real, uncorporatized, and individual. A refreshing change from Downtown Project's approach (Container Park is just trying way too hard). It's just one block away from other amazing eats like Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. (We hopped to Art of Flavors afterwards for a sweet contrast!)

I'd love to come back and pack a few sandwiches and hit the park with picnic blankets and a book.

The new location, at the corner of Parthenais, is charming, with cozy wooden fixtures, a table and chairs in the front window, their famous cone-winding machines on display in the back, and a crystal chandelier in the front window! 

For all that charm and class, however, the merchandise inside is decidedly ""meh"". They stock a small amount of brand-name yarn, things like Patons sock yarn and some of the Stitch 'n' Bitch branded bamboo blend yarn, but these are both craft-store yarns like you can find at Michael's or Omer DeSerres. Aside from that, they have a wall of acrylic yarn at $5.50 per 100g, and also a wall of 100% wool at the same price. I've heard some stories about the old Bobineuse yarn which leave me skeptical, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because the shop is under new ownership. In any case, we're talking solid, solid yarns in Red Heart-esque logs.

The shop seems to push its cones, as well as its big balls of superbulky yarns, made up of several strands of other yarns for a multi-color and multi-texture effect. Sort of like what Yarnia in Portland OR does, but not as well, because they don't seem to have the range of weights and fiber contents that Yarnia stocks. They also have a small selection of notions (possibly from the 1980s...including a ""mohair brush""), and what seems to be a lot of mismatched or no-name bamboo knitting needles. Sort of like what you can buy in bulk from China.

In their previous spot a bit further east on Mont-Royal, I'd poked my head in the door and quickly turned around, realizing that this was *not* the kind of yarn shop I was looking for, yarn-snob as I am. With the new locale and classy atmosphere I thought maybe the shop had seen a change of direction, but although it's less cluttered and slightly better curated than before, it's still a far, far cry from ""fancy yarn store"" like its exterior suggests.

(So, after poking around their website, I realize now that this rebranding actually signifies a shift in management, as their longtime owner Daniel is retiring and handing over the shop to a new generation. This gives me a lot of optimism, actually. The website is lovely, aims at bilingualism (broken links abound at the moment), and it is full of potential.

Food was good. We had the dark spice Taiwanese chicken. The meat was seasoned well, though it seems a tad more pricy than what I would normally pay for the meal.

First Trip: My husband works abroad, therefore I went to pick up the alterations on  August 2013, with a receipt marked PAID.  The lady (owner) stated the alternations were not paid and refused to relinquish my husband suits, even with the receipt marked PAID.  Her theory: if the other two carbon receipts were not marked PAID, the transaction did not occur.   

Second Trip: My husband was very adamant about the fact that he paid and he reassured me. I went back to the shop and asked if she could research her records plus the receipt was marked PAID.  She refused to relinquish the suits; she was very rude and basically ignored me. 

Third Trip: Now, I am second-guessing my husband, because this is asinine. However my husband has a great memory and he deals with numbers all day therefore I attempted to visit the shop again.  She still refused to relinquish the suits. I asked again if she could ""please"" check her financial records, check the register...anything... I just want to pick up my husband suits. 

Still no suits...my husband spent some time checking our bank statements and there was a payment of $114.00 made on July 5, 2013 with a reference number from Matthews Alterations.  My husband immediately called the owner, she told him, the police had his suits.  I called the lady and stated we had proof we paid and I can swing by and bring our statement...she immediately cut me off and said she was going to call the police and that his suits were at the police station. She also mentioned we didn't want to pay for the suits we just wanted a free service.  

 After the phone call, I had a police officer call me and asked if I could meet him at the shop.  I arrive at the shop and there were two squad cars. I showed the police  proof of payment as well as well as the owner. She then tried to say my bank statement wasn't real, wanted to copy my bank statement (which is illegal) and just because the word ""PAID"" was not written on her calendar marked July 5th the payment was not real.   The police officer had to reassure her the bank statement was legit.  

Long story longer...the look of total humiliation on her face was indeed priceless.  At each attempt, my husband and I were never disrespectful, and kept every visit professional. She was very rude, unprofessional, voided my existence, and lied about the suits being at the police station.

Her bookkeeping is antiquated and suspicious and the shop is filthy!

I have hypothyroidism and am estrogen dominant which causes me to be overweight. Being on the pill for the better part of 14 years has also contributed to weight gain which is part of why I want to stop taking it. I assured him I eat a plant based diet and exercise regularly and my overall (good) health reflects my lifestyle choices. This fell on deaf ears. 
Next, the actual pap smear was awful. I was pretty tense after being made to feel on the defensive and not even humored with a discussion about the reasons I was in his office. This led to a painful pap- something I didn't even know was possible. I was pretty tense and did not have a chance to relax before the speculum was inserted. On top of this let's just say his method for obtaining the pap also more resembled vigorous tooth brushing.

I was raised in Miami, and I occasionally get home sick and crave good Cuban food! I have been to all the Cuban restaurants in town -  this is my favorite!

If you want a sampling of a Cuban sandwich with their mariquitas, which are fried thin green plantains, I recommend the appetizer Mini Cuban Sandwich. It has tender roasted sliced port, ham, cheese, pickles, with mustard. Then it is pressed on a grill. Don't get the fries - try the plantains in their mojo garlic lemon sauce.

For my entree' I had the Lechon Al Despelote, which is chunks of roasted leg of pork served on fried yuca and topped with melted cheese.  There are three small servings of pork\/yucca to this order with your choice of black beans and rice (more wet with rice and beans served separately) or Moros Y Christianos (black beans & white rice cooked together) for a more dry helping of black beans and rice.  I prefer the separate order so it is moist when I combine them. This was an excellent meal even though the portion of pork\/yucca is very small. The cost is $16.00.

He had the Palomilla Empanizada, which is the sirloin steak that is thinly sliced and breaded. It is topped with grilled onions. He really enjoyed this. One of my favorites is the Bistec De Palomilla, which is similar to his order above except it is not breaded. Both come with the same selection of rice\/beans and are also priced at $16.00.

Other items I enjoy from Havana Grill are their Plantains Maduros, which are fried sweet, ripe caramelized plantains. I don't always have room for dessert, but I do enjoy both the Flan Cubano (caramel custard) and the Cake De Tres Leches (white cake\/three in three milks).

 Banking, Pharmaceuticals, Dry Cleaning, Wine  and heck even some half-decent clothes shopping.  All that's missing is a Legal Services booth from Bob Loblaw http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mwWAsNZTnug

The Musgrave location of Loblaws is pretty big and shiny, and although it's not a Supercentre, it holds it's own with fairly decent prepped foods, fish, and bakery counters.  There is also an attractive, airy balconied seating area for eating on the upper level.

The produce and prepared veggies and fruits aren't great at this location.  The pre-prepped salads seem fresh enough for hubby's liking, but the pre-chopped cantaloupe and honeydew melons seem to always go bad sooner than the best before date :(

The Organic, healthy foods section is okay-ish, if not a little more expensive than competitors pricing of similar goods, but when there's a markdown Loblaw's means business and sometimes pricier items like Nature's Path Cereals go for 3 for $10.

For processed foods and sundries you can't beat Loblaw's President's Choice for their dizzying array of everything from salad tongs to Gluten free ""Smart"" cookies (my current fave PC product) President's Choice's unrelenting mission to expand my waistline is pretty successful especially close to Xmas, when I swear they must have little elves churning out mad PC cookies, candies and egg nog flavoured everything for our gross consumption...it's a little crazy albeit in a delicious way.

The Joe Fresh selection is meh-to-okay here, but it's enough of a distraction that hubby can find me frolicking here marvelling at freakishly adorable baby booties and little girls clothes instead of actually grocery shopping in the frozen veggies aisle.

I will credit Loblaws for making grocery shopping less of a chore and more of a spendy adventure. As long as you're well disciplined and stick to your list of grocery items, you can get all the essentials, not like me and my spendthrift cosmetics crack meltdowns...one day I'll leave here without buying another nail polish or lipgloss or mascara or...",2,3,2,"""Loblaws Supermarkets""",Upper Beach,"""50 Musgrave Street""",Toronto,ON,M4E 3W2,43.6884778,-79.2882626,3.0,12,1,Food;Grocery

The waiter was friendly, attentive, and professional. He definitely made his presence known, but comfortably enough for us to know he was around if we had any requests.

Ordered:
Canyon Creek dip - Consisted of 2 dips 1) a warm spinach dip w\/cheese 2) salsa. The spinach dip was delightful. It wasn't heavy on the cheese, but satisfying to start off the meal. The salsa was a bit disappointing, nothing particularly special.

Summer prix-fixe menu ($29.95)
Chophouse salad - Consisted of lettuce, tomatoes, raspberry vinegrette, blue cheese. Overall, I didn't like this combination for my salad. Should have stuck with the caesar salad.

Prime rib w\/ baked potato - Medium rare. I enjoyed it, but it was pretty standard.

I heard the HYPE around Topgolf and was really excited to take my mind off Hurricane Irma at Topgolf with some family. Unfortunately, the experience was one of the worst I've ever had. Please note: this is only my 2nd 1st review EVER.

The line was out the door, so I assumed that the hype was right and it would be worth the wait. We were quoted about an hour or two for a bay, but we didn't have a problem with that since we were hungry. We went to an open rooftop bar to grab drinks and lunch. After 30 minutes, we realized that we weren't going to be served without hunting someone down.

Finally, we ordered and got our drinks. First, they brought out four appetizers when we only ordered two. Unfortunately, our server had us pay BEFORE we got our food since we were going to move to a bay, and we paid an extra $18 for the two appetizers that we didn't order. Granted that's our fault for not paying closer attention to the bill.

We moved to the bay, and our server told us that he'd have our food brought to the new bay. When it finally came, there were a lot of missing items from the order, and the food was cold. Most likely, the food had been sitting for a while since our first server was not very bright. Our server at the bay didn't make our experience any better. I actually ordered two more beers from a server at another bay since our server Jessie never came back for us. Corrie was the server that I hunted down, and he did get me the two beers but I had to open a separate tab with him.

The manager did stop by but her customer service skills were no better than anyone else that we interacted with. She blamed us for the problem, didn't listen to the situation, and didn't have any resolution before she just walked away...

I've rented a costume twice from this store and I plan on never renting from here again. I'll be giving honest feedback of both the pros and cons pertaining to this business.
CONS
1) Fees, Fees, Fees - If you're looking to rent beware. I got charged a $100 late fee for turning my costume in 1 DAY late, which was the price I paid to rent it. Grant it, it does state this in the contract (although in small print), but I was never informed of this at the time of the rental, which would have been nice. In addition, I have a job so getting there during business hours is a tad tricky for me. Also, if there's any itty-bitty damage, they'll charge you for that as well. This is clearly how they make up their margins and to me it's a poor business practice. I'm not arguing the concept of late fees. I understand items need to be returned, but the amount is irrational. So for $200 you could buy something pretty elaborate and never have to return it.
2) Most of the staff (I say most bc not all the staff was bad) is either too pushy or rude. This doesn't really bother me as a whole. It's a costume store so I'm not expecting to be blown away by superior customer service like I would at a high end retailer but they act as if they're doing you a favor by renting you a costume. And they do definitely follow you around and watch you like a hawk as if you're going to run out with their items (maybe people have in the past?)
3) Pricing - when it comes to pricing it seems like you're paying whatever they feel like charging that day. I paid different prices each year and there doesn't seem to be any method to their madness. 

PROS 
1) They do have a cool selection of items. However, I rather purchase something from Goodwill then pay $100 for something I will only wear once ($200-$1000 depending on damage and\/or late fees). I do think you're better off purchasing something online or at another Halloween store. However, if you are looking for something extravagant this could be your move but just make sure you shoot over to the store as soon as the holiday ends or they'll start tacking on the fees.
2) The workers do seem passionate about costumes and pairing items. But again, this is hit or miss depending on who you work with as you can see from some previous reviews as well.

Hopefully this is helpful. I don't want to give the impression that it's all bad because it's not. I just don't agree with how they manage certain areas of their business, and I think it will certainly lead them to losing repeat customers like me and I'm sure others.",5,0,0,"""Costume World""",Strip District,"""1690 Smallman St""",Pittsburgh,PA,15222,40.4501061,-79.9867628,3.0,13,1,Costumes;Beauty & Spas;Makeup Artists;Wigs;Shopping;Used;Vintage & Consignment;Arts & Crafts;Fashion

The only people I would recommend here are lil and big Kim they are both amazing and exempt from this review. Having said that every other time I have visited this salon has been a complete waste of time and money. When I pay 100 for a mani\/pedi I expect clean work and good service. Yesterday kin did my mani (perfect as usual) and I was handed off to someone else for my pedi. He was in a hurry and did a seriously sloppy job not to mention he was rough with me. He filed my skin and cut my toes multiple times! My feet look like I need a pedicure and I had one less than 24hrs ago! Not what I expect when being charged $55 for my toes. After 3 hrs at this salon their only suggestion was I sit there and have it all redone. Who has that much time to waste? I will NEVER come back here. It's a shame because both Kim's do amazing work.

I worked for this company for over 3 years as a branch manager.  
 
The first thing I noticed was how unsafe the equipment and trucks were that's provided for the movers. The equipment is worn out and in terrible condition. The dolly's wheels fall off, the straps to tie the customer's furniture are worn out and the trucks are even worse!!!  

One of the trucks I had #379 had a somewhat large hole in the floor where the movers had to step around in order to load furniture onto the truck. I notified my Regional Director about 10 times -- YES 10 times and it was never fixed. The trucks would also leak when it rains on the customer's items and break down because the company was too cheap to fix anything so the movers would show up late to customers and sometimes not show up at all.  

The second thing I noticed is how Starving Students treat their employees. The movers only get paid minimum wage to move extremely heavy furniture sometimes in severe weather conditions with no heater or A\/C in the trucks.  The company also consistently didn't pay the movers on time when the company knows they live pay check to pay check -- sometimes a week late.   So you get what you pay for and damaged furniture is a direct reflection of how the employees are treated by the company - don't care.

The reason I am writing this review is I was laid-off TWO WEEKS before Christmas due to ""branch being closed down"".   About a month prior to my layoff the owner sent an email to the entire company saying all branches needed to meet certain criteria in November in order to avoid being closed down.  My branch met the criteria where many branches did not so they laid me off anyway.  

I believe the real reason I was laid off is because I had applied for intermittent Famliy Medical Leave because I started having panic attacks at work due to the stress and poor working conditions. The VP of Operations, had called me directly to try to TALK ME OUT OF TAKING FMLA just prior to laying me off. I apologized and explained I really needed the FMLA.  

It was very obvious the VP was upset about me taking FMLA and decided to close my branch.  When I started at Starving Students Moving, my branch was ranked #27 out of 35 branches.  Within my first year of running the branch, my ranking went from 27 to being in the top 5 consistently until the day they laid me off.  If anything, my employees were much more stable less turnover, less claims, more sales - happier and profitable.

Don't use them if not for me for yourself and your sanity -- God Bless",0,0,0,"""Starving Students""",,"""6845 N Black Canyon Hwy""",Phoenix,AZ,85015,33.5378954,-112.111618,1.0,5,0,Home Services;Movers;Self Storage;Local Services

Its a bit expensive so we cant go there all the time, but as a group of 5 we enjoyed this high end old school posh restaurant.  Our reservation was at 6:30 and we were seated almost immediately by a very courteous and attentive host, and fussed over by a team of excellent professional wait staff.  This was truly a great culinary adventure because we were celebrating my fathers birthday, so this just added to a special night for all of us.  The menu is very diversified and there is something for everyone.  Starting with the complimentary appetizers, brought to the table which include garlic bread, pickles and cottage cheese, everything was fresh and the flavors were strong and outstanding.  Mmmm the garlic, gotta love it and its great for vampire repellent too.  Dual purpose appetizers always float my boat.  Moving on to the salads, they were good, but when you go to a steak house the salad isnt the main event, as the late John Pinette once said, ""salad is the promise that real food is coming"".  And that it did.  Large juicy portions of prime rib for the parents, cooked to perfection.  Its been a while since i have seen such attractive plates with grilled veggies on the side and a slab of cow that would make native Albertans proud.  Dont forget the baked potato on the side slathered in sour cream.  This made for some happy parents to have this meal bestowed upon them.  For the wife, she had the Steak Neptune, again cooked to perfection and topped with seafood and a lovely Hollandaise sauce with beautiful seasonal veggies on the side.  My son decided to be adventurous and try something new to him and picked the penne pasta topped with tomato sauce and grilled chicken.  Now, i have to say, when you are at a steak house, pasta does not even register with me.  However, once you try this, you will change your mind.  He loved it and it was cooked to perfection.  I had to try a sample of it just to see for myself and this dish is a winner.  The sauce was tangy and permeated with parmigiana cheese, the pasta cooked perfectly, and the sear on the chicken was perfect and yet so tender and juicy inside i may have to take a crack at this myself one day.  For myself, i had the Filet Mignon.  Once again they outdid themselves with this thick tender steak wrapped in bacon.  The sear was perfect and the lovely pink medium was spot on to my taste.  The veggies on the side, especially the red pepper just added to the experience which was topped off with a baked potato.  If you think thats it, well, there was also desert.  Now i myself did not take part in the desert menu, I was more than satisfied with the portions and the samples of others around me so i had to opt out, but I will say, the various deserts around the table were polished off with rave reviews from my fellow diners.  Next time i will have to save room for desert knowing that i may have missed out on something special.

Food is as good as or better than anything I've had in Boston\/NYC without the rip-off factor.

Both times I had the flank steak, which comes with sauteed green beans and these hashbrown-like crispy potatoes that are to die for. I've also had their mushroom soup and regular dinner salad (which is loaded with figs and some fun cheeses) and both were awesome. The one thing not to miss, however, is the Raclette. Ask for extra peppercorns, you will not be disappointed. I know few things better than a slab of baked, melted cheese on a plate. It's served with a side of gherkin pickles, which sounds strange but the combination is really incredible. I have also had tried their creme brulee and chocolate torte, both fantastic.

When we arrived late on a Friday my Dad went to check-in and the hotel bar was going crazy. However the lady helping us couldn't find his reservation, was rude and honestly seemed like she could careless. Finally another employee came over to help who was very helpful and we got on our way. 

The rooms are a nice size and modern. The rooms look like a college kid got his parent credit card and went nuts at Ikea! But overall nice looking and comfortable.

He was very knowledgable and helped us in selecting the perfect bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary . Nick the service manager was also very friendly and attentive and ensured we had the perfect experience. Timing of food delivery was perfection. Never rushed nor felt like we were waiting for a long period of time. We started with the cornbread appetizer accompanied with honey.  Not an item for calorie counters, but totally worth every pound gained! My husband had the wedge salad. He thoroughly enjoyed! I ordered the Main side salad. Perfectly dressed with an herb vinaigrette and topped with bacon and cornbread crumbles. For entrees my husband ordered the filet. Seriously the best piece of meat I have ever tasted!!

I ordered the crab cakes which came on bread crackers.. 

Chard\/black eye peas

Salmon sushi rolls. 

Ok, so the good.. If your a fish place and you mess up on basic rolls, i will send it back and never visit again! But it was good. So for that thank you.

The crabcakes are just wrong.  First.. They looked like flattened crab strips pushed togather in a cheap way to make it appear your getting a crab cake. ( even on happy hour..no) they were bland and not fluffy or juicy. Also not breaded etc. Just pushed togather crab,flattened .. Idk. Then topped on a cracked bread type thing, that was overly buttered and salty. No. Just no. 

The chard and black eyed peas.. Under seasoned! Seriously your making two very ethnic items and putting them togather.. Bring on the seasoning. It was just ok.

The menu was put togather very oddly and confusing. Also..price the items , alllll the items . Seriously. Your servicing an upscale crowd fish we expect a higher price than pita jungle, don't have us asking the waitress because often the prices doesn't suit the meal.

A fish place also should have more fish options.. Ijs. Its just a confusing menu and concept.

First off we reserve a table in advance and we got there a little after 10:00 Friday and there was a line all the way to the casino doors.

He told me that I would have to get through the crowd people fighting to get to the club behind the red rope and seriously it looked like a scene from the Titanic with people fighting to get on a life boat. So finally I said screw this and I went around the back side where there was no people and this time I had to work my mojo and get one of the other bouncers attention so I ended up greasing the guy $20.00 to get us to the front of the line which worked to my surprise. So then checked in and we were on our way to our table.

 Get to our table which was in the patio area like I requested and  got setup with bottle service,  our service was good with our waitress and security inside was pretty cool. The view was nice on the patio.

    Get down stairs to the to the main club and the dance floor was the size of there bathroom and if you wanted to walk around the club you would need a wristband for that specific room.

One member of our party had the wrong burrito delivered 3 times. a simple request, no cheese, really three times! Even the food served correctly was marginal at best. 
Then we ordered two crepes. They were basically dough that had not been grilled, baked, or whatever you do to a crepe to make it edible. How this was served is beyond me. The waitress, as she looked and saw we had not eaten them ,made no attempt to find out what the problem was. Of course just looking at them it was clear they were not made correctly.
Never again. I am amazed anyone liked this restaurant. Our server had a bad attitude from the first time she came to the table.

I went into get 4 wisdom teeth taken out and woke up during the surgery to pain. I over hear one of the nurses saying this has been happening a lot lately before they proceeded to give me more anthisteshia. When I wake up after surgery I'm told that the surgeon was only able to get two teeth out and that I would have to reschedule a week later to get the other two out. This healing process has took me out of work over a month due to them not getting the job done the first place. When I came back my second time to get the other two wisdom teeth out they lost my X-rays and needed me to do them again and when I went back to get my shot of saline the nurse tells me they have a new nurse and she was going to give me the shot. It took this nurse 10 minutes to give me a saline shot and blood was all over my hand as she had no idea what she was doing. While she gives me this shot the nurse behind her is wincing her face due to the blood and pain she was causing me and when she looked at me watching her make the face she apologized to me and walked in other room. I had severe anxiety at this point and my left Pupil went bigger then my right and they had to bring another doctor in to make sure I wasn't having a stroke. Once they realize that I wasn't having the stroke they proceeded with the surgery. This time the surgeon did a good job but when I woke up they gave my girlfriend my prescriptions which she then dropped off with me at cvs after the surgery. I had this procedure done on Feb 11th and the doctor calls me an hour later to say that they put January 4th on my script and because they screwed up the date cvs can fill my prescription. They then tell me while I'm still groggy from the procedure that if I want my medicine I had to drive 30 minutes back to there office to pick up new scripts. They left me without my pain medicine and left me in pain during this recovery. Not too mention there doctor has an out of state number and when I was suffering from severe headache and discharge the receptionist tells me it's going to take 4 days for them to get a hold of the doctor. I am warning anyone who goes to this establishment to stay away! They are a crooked business and should be closed down for malpractice. I am a very busy man and wanted to take the time to personally review this place so that all of you will think twice of going.,0,0,0,"""Simply Wisdom Teeth""",,"""4090 N Martin L King Blvd""",North Las Vegas,NV,89032,36.233357,-115.160895,4.0,7,1,Health & Medical;Dentists;General Dentistry

I admit in the beginning they had me hooked! I would eat there 3-4 Times a week since I'm in the industry I'd stop in on my way to work to get food for myself and other employees since after working at any restaurant for long periods of time makes eating there kinda boring no matter how good the food is. Anyway the sandwich, sides and canolis and bagles were fresh and delicious at the time. Than one day the canolis were soggy and just NOT very fresh at all. The first time I did nothing just figured it happens and it was not a sign they were NEVER GOING to be fresh again not the case!! It happened again so this time I took them (more than one) back an they refunded my money with a very weak apology. A couple days later I stopped in placed my order an DIDN'T order the canolis since they just DIDN'T LOOK good an by now they knew i ALWAYS bought canolis and the young lady asked if I wanted some. I said yes if their a new batch and fresh of course. She felt them and said they are with that I said sure 4 please. As she went to box them up I asked if the shell felt firm and crispy she began to say YES yet as she felt them she said honestly I don't think their as fresh as I thought tommorow morning ill make new ones. I thanked her for her honesty went back the next day only to see the same old yellowing at the end canolis so I asked again if they were a new fresh batch only to be told they had NO idea how old they are and the young lady from the day before was no where in site to ask!!! Now, being in the industry I KNOW ALL food is supposed to be labeled dated an  knowledge of preparation date!  That concerned me yet the meat cheese and veggies on the sandwich always seemed fresh at the time. Not so much as of the last couple of visits which btw the canolis still are noted as unknown freshness and their words, prefer not to chance it 2 MONTHS LATER!! WHAT??After the first couple of times eating there we also noticed small things like they DIDN'T put an item on the sandwich or the bagel just seemed old and a day or so old. At this point I took a break for about a month returned there today ordered my usually sandwich asked if they could please add extra horseradish sauce on my sandwich which they actually put less on THERE ALMOST felt intentional since I ASKED how are the canolis? Are they fresh today as I smiled hoping to hear of course. Nope! Again told she had NO IDEA WHEN THEY were MADE. I'm sure the disappointment showed on my face and I finally asked HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW LONG ITS BEEN SINCE THEY WERE MADE WITH FRUSTRATION AND DISAPPOINTMENT I got my food to go got home opened it only to see the cucumber\/celery salad was soggy and limp which ISN'T how its been served BEFORE. Ok calm down I told myself! Picked up my sandwich to see the havarti cheese I pay EXTRA for BTW is hard and dried out around the edge! Oh MY goodness seriously?? So I decided to open the sandwich to LOOK at the roast beef to see if it seemed SAFE to eat and it did YET remember that extra horseradish sauce I requested? It was none existing and the lettuce was whilted! WOW a 100% total fail on a sandwich I was so looking forward to since I took a break for a while. I'm going to take the whilted lettuce soggy cucumber salad and hard around the edge havarti cheese back an request to SPEAK TO THE manager or owner about the lack of quality and concerns for the food they are selling, do I think it's going to change anything probably not since if the employees are that unaware of the product they are selling, making and serving I'm willing to bet it's due to the lack of concern an leadership of the person running the establishment.

A goodly amount of pickle slices was supplied, and it took me awhile to finish them all--which was a good thing, because I could savor each disc while I waited for my sandwich to be prepared at the Devilicious food truck nearby.

We got a cabeza burrito and al pastor burrito. I love real Mexican food so whenever I see lengua and\/or cabeza on the menu I get excited. The cabeza had no flavor whatsoever. Super bland. The al pastor wasn't that tender and also under seasoned.  The big problem for me was too many frijoles! In hindsight, ok this place is called Frijoles, and I like beans; I don't want a burrito with 75% beans! And shocker, bland!  The salsas were thin and watery and not hot enough. The only redeeming factor was the tortillas. I liked the chewy texture.

It looks fun from the outside. I was impressed when I read somewhere that Mr McCaffrey introduced Guinness to Phoenix. Since the owners are from Ireland, I was anticipating an authentic Irish experience here.

Well, our first impression was, shall I say, odd. We walked in the main entrance and were greeted by...nobody. The place looked empty at first, and we wondered if we had come through the wrong door. We walked around trying to figure out where we were supposed to be, got funny looks from people at the bar, then returned from whence we came, only to discover a small sign instructing us to seat ourselves. Whoops!

We chose a booth and wondered how anyone would know we were there. After a bit (maybe 5 minutes?) a very nice waitress greeted us saying ""I didn't see you guys all the way over here!"" She took our drink order (water - we're easy to please in that regard) and swiftly returned with our beverages. The swiftness did not continue, however.

We probably sat there about 15 or 20 minutes waiting to give our waitress our orders. Mind you, the HUGE place was near empty. When she finally returned to us, she asked us if we were okay, and apologized, saying she had forgotten about us.

The ambiance was nice and Irish-like. However, I will say that I wished they had chosen Irish music to play over the stereo, rather than assorted genres of 90s American music. Weird.

Now onto the food. They didn't seem to have much on the menu that seemed very authentically Irish. Maybe the Irish don't have much variety in their food? At any rate, I had the corned beef and cabbage, and my other half had the shepherd's pie. Both were good, but not as good as I had hoped for. Fresh ingredients would have made a big difference. Also, it was disappointing that there was ground beef, not sheep, in the shepherd's pie.

I watched, as we waited for food, and saw the gentleman from the counter hand a To-go bag to customers, look them sincerely in the eyes & shake their hand as if to say, ""thank you for your patronage, please come again & enjoy your delicious meal"".

Oh, that's right the food. 

Our former spot's gyro had a lot of taziki sauce which was fine but made for a messy meal and hid the fact that the meat itself was decent but not excellent. 

This Gyro was phenomenal. From the soft toasted bread to the minimal but perfect amount of sauce and the tender moist and generous portion of Gyro meat. The hubs had his favorite Chicken Shawarma -could barely utter the words ""Iss izz da bess shwaaa ma..evvvah"". Plus their fries & sides? Da bomb. 

After an amazing meal for two people that cost the same price as a supersize-me meals or just one entree elsewhere --we let the owner know about how happy we were to find them. He was gracious and thanked us saying he's been in this business for 30 years. It showed.

And get this-- when we told him about the other Mediterranean place nearby that closed down--his first reaction was sincere sadness that a fellow business owner shut down. It left us humbled at this mans' pride in his culture & craft.

Since then, we've been back a few times per year since we live on the other side of town.  Each time, we've never been disappointed including our family and friends who we've taken over time.  Today, the wife and I decided to have brunch there for Mamacita Day since we were coming from Town Sq.  Good thing we did.  

First off, they had a special buffet menu for Mother's Day which they allowed customers to sample over 10 items, and as many times as we wanted... all for $20.  They were trying to do something different for special occasions, and to drive more traffic during non-peak time according to their Corp Chef, Kellen, who happened to be there today and came out to chat with us about our dining experience.  That was pretty cool... and let us tell you, their potential new menu items were all AWESOME with a capital ""A""!    And so was our server Alex!

On with the food for all you foodies!  
Instead of our regular Oxtail chili cheese fries and Banmi Burgers being avail, they had bottomless mimosas for all moms, and $5 bottomless for everyone else.  All dishes were petite size which allowed you to taste several dishes before getting full.  But if you found something you liked, you could order more.  The short rib hash w\/sunny side egg was probably the best dish of the day.  Talk about Asian\/American fusion food... Hope this item makes it on their potential new breakfast menu.  We had something very similar in Philly recently, but this was by far much tastier.  We also had their Wagyu sliders, Pan roasted chicken, Smoked Salmon Benedict, maple glazed bacon and sausage, and Pork belly sliders to name a few.   If you're a fan of pork belly, you've got to come to this joint.  I really like the sliders over at Fat Chows, but Bachi has hands down the best in town!  They apparently cook the pork 3 different times before serving them with the right amount of Hoisen sauce.   It's oven cooked, deep fried, then pan sautéed before serving.   Yum and borderline take us to ""Ohio""!

The seitan meat even tastes like actual meat. I've loved everything on the menu that I've had so far. There's cheap options and more expensive things.

I thought the quality of the food was decent. There are a handful of individually made mini dishes at every station. Entrées are pretty typical for a standard buffet. You have the carving station, asian section, pasta section, 2 crab leg stations, and a dessert booth. 

My biggest issue was the selection and variety of items available. I was pretty surprised at the lackluster sushi station. The sushi was rock hard, and the sashimi looked horrible.

The restaurant opened just a few weeks ago and I was lured by a promise of a free appetizer w\/ entree purchase for hotel guests.

The decor is casual but very stylish and it's clear there was a lot of attention to detail when deigning this place.  I sat at the bar since I was eating alone and was served by multiple bar staff who were all very friendly and attentive.  I took FOREVER to browse the menu because literally everything sounded delicious.  I settled on the Gazpacho appetizer, Fish and Chips, and a glass of white wine.

The Gazpacho was incredible, and I don't even like tomatoes!  It had lots of flavor and came with a little scoop of pineapple sorbet floating in the bowl.  The fish and chips was also delicious, but had a twist: the fries had a curry aioli, feta cheese, green onions and bacon on top.  Sounds like a weird combo but it worked!

The bar also had a large selection of draft beers and a huge selection of bottled craft beer, which was neatly displayed in glass-front refrigerators below the bar...almost like an extra work of art!

We asked for recommendations on appetizers and the server recommended some kind of buffalo chicken eggrolls...said they were her favorite. We took her suggestion and ordered those and one other appetizer. 

We then put in our order for food. 

Appetizers never came. 

Then the food came out...well...3 of the 4 meals came out. 
Haha. The 4th was a few minutes later which was super awkward for the 3 of us who got our food. 

Mine was a burger and the burger was good...cooked as ordered, etc... but I ordered sweet potato tots and got regular. When the 4th meal finally came out, we asked about the tots. They brought a bowl of sweet potato tots out. Thank goodness they left me the regular ones because the sweet ones were cold, soggy, and pretty gross. 

The server never noticed that she didn't bring our appetizers. Of course, she didn't come back very often, so maybe that was why. Luckily they weren't on the bill, so we didn't have to argue about that. It took long enough to get the check and get it back that any additional delay would have been torture.

However, if there was a story, I had no idea what it was.  But to be fair, we sat in the VIP suites at the back of the theater.  Private suites that seat four (although we had only two in our party) with a bottle of champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries and truffles.  So I probably spent more time counting how many chocolates my husband was taking over his 50% than paying attention.

The private entrance came in handy when my husband claimed he set an alarm for 6 pm and yet I woke up at 7:10 wondering why I was so well-rested.  After the fastest costume change ever, we literally ran to the theater and arrived just after it started, but did not disturb anyone.  The cocktail server whisked in just behind us to open the champagne.  I was miffed at my husband for missing the chance to get our photo, but a photographer came to our suite before I had a chance to start bitching.  

Sadly, the $335 per ticket price did not include a photo, which I looked hideous in, but yet I still felt compelled to buy both for $90 so I could study at my leisure which one was less ghastly.  I am just grateful he told me to pose in such a way to hide the arm fat.  I later got an email that I could buy a digital download which I would have rather done to begin with so I could work my wonders with Photoshop.

Having not done bottle service before, Chelsea was patient and explained everything to me. Thanks to a cancelation, we were able to get a larger booth.  We had 10 in our group and we were very comfortable in our booth.  

The crowd is very young and the place was packed (cheek to cheek) on a Saturday night.  We arrived at 10 and I was very happy that we had done the bottle service. The dance floor is very small not very well laid our for a country bar. All of the ladies in our group ended up dancing on the table.  They had a great time.

The bathrooms are undersized (4-holes in the men's room) for a club of this size.  Drinks were reasonably priced.  Our waitress was very busy, as would be expected in a hot Scottsdale club on a Saturday night, but she kept us hydrated.

The only complaint that I have is that they have these cool table taps.  Well the taps have been shut down because of some many problems with the metering device.  Our hostess Chelsea offered to turn them ON, but warned that we would be responsible and that there have been problems.  Kudos for shutting them down and not continuing to screw-people over, but get the damn thing fixed.

This is a very Scottsdale trendy spot (juiced up bouncers, hot little waitresses, too much Affliction-wear and young ladies in platform heels), with a mix of country music.  The DJ did a good job of keeping the dance floor (all 20' x 20' of it) packed all night.

Dear Cyros, 
Thanks for being conveniently located to South Park and a low key sushi joint. 

Hubs and I ducked in here one very rainy Thursday and it was SLAMMED. So slammed that the servers, owner and hostess thanked us for our patience. That was indeed a nice touch. That being said, I'm really glad we made a last minute Open Table reserv and were seated right away. The place itself has simple, yet modern decor. Not too many frills and not too many tables either. But that's ok, as long as the food is delicious it doesn't matter much to me!

We ordered a handful of rolls and one appetizer...

Yellowtail Hamachi with Jalapeno: Fresh, thin slices of yellowtail topped with slices of jalapeno and a peppery, citrus-y sauce. The fish was great and I liked the taste of the sauce, but not the consistency. It was a bit grainy.

Nobu Fire roll: Really fresh fish and super duper spicy. Like I was draining my water over and over again spicy. Next time I'm getting the sauce on the side. 

Spicy Tuna roll: Their basic spicy tuna. As others, very fresh.

Firey Tuna Roll: Another spicy one with a generous helping of spicy tuna on top. 

Overall, Cyros is a pleasant sushi stop in Southpark. Will I be a lifer here?

The setup itself is totally legit...a few tables in front of a bar in the corner, a stage, and an awesome little patio nestled in between the old house and Jobot. 

The beer selection is on point, and has improved over the years in two aspects: Rotating seasonal brews, and the installment of local brews on draft. My go-to is the Lumberyard Red, but unlike my 21-year-old self I freaking love the IPAs, and they usually have them. The wine selection is also small, but good. Get the Malbec...or the sake. It's like $15 (for the bottle! Wow! I'd pay more!) and by far the best way to get sloshed. In style. 

If you're being cheap--or just want something light to cap a night of binging--there's always $2 PBR. Groovy. 

It's about more than just drinking, of course. They make an effort to have at least one live set EVERY SINGLE NIGHT. That cannot be beat. Jam out while you check out the local art for sale.

My experience the first 5 times was good.  I like the flavor of the sauce and had good experiences.  In fact, on my recommendation, one of my friends had her birthday party here.  Everyone had a good time and we ended up with a bill over $400 but it was worth it.  
  
Why the 2 stars you ask?  Because visit 6 SUCKED!  And I mean SUCKED BAD.  I ordered a pound of shrimp with a corn.  The food runner dropped off the shrimp and repeated the order then took off to deliver to another table.  Right away I noticed two things, there was no corn and that the amount of shrimp in the bag was very small.  When we got a hold of an employee, we told her that there was no corn and asked if that was a pound.  She held up the bag and asked if we ordered a full pound or a half.  We replied that we ordered a full pound.  She said that this couldn't be our order and took the bag away.  A couple minutes later, the chicken wings arrived.  They were excellent as always.  By the time we finished the wings, the shrimp still hadn't arrived.  Our original server dropped off a corn in a bag, but no shrimp.  The first girl came by a few minutes later and said that the first bag had to be our order because she has been watching it and nobody has taken it.  Then to my shock, she said that she would go get it.  I told her that I didn't want that bag because after 15 min of steaming in the bad, it would be way overcooked.  She looked a but stunned and paused.  I told her not to bring me that same bag.  At the same time, the original server was bringing it over.  She intercepted him and told him that I didn't want that bag.  They went over to the cashier area and discussed something with some others.  They came over and told me that the order was being remade.  To this point, I was fine with the proceedings.  I figured that ""shit happens"" and no big deal.  Then the shrimp arrived.  If someone tells me that wasn't the same shrimp, I'll tell them that they are a f'kn liar.  The shrimp was so overcooked that all of the heads had fallen off.  The meat was mush and stuck to the shells.

Besides Melissa McCarthy I don't think women are particularly funny. The first guy up was Sam Fedele and this guy was funny. I think the best comedians are the ones who joke about stuff we can all relate to and this guy does. I give him 4 stars. The second guy up was Erik Rivera and his entire act focused around his ethnicity. I'm not Puerto Rican or Guatemalan so I can't relate. He wasn't as bad as the girl, but I wasn't impressed. Like I said, I need to relate to the jokes. Overall, I wouldn't go back because I can see their same acts on Youtube.

It was light fluffy and filled with caramel and had a brûlée banana on top of it. Very tasty. 
Lunch items I tried was their Caesar salad, mac and cheese, turkey and tacos and meatballs. And of course some Chinese food. It was all tasty.  It didn't taste like it has been sitting for hours which was nice. 
My favorite had to have been dessert. It is just something everyone has to save room for. There are so many options it is bound to satisfy even the most picky of dessert eaters. I was impressed that their creme brûlée was actually one with a crisp top. Super excited about that.

I was a bit hesitant about the food based on some of the reviews, but no worries, everything was great.  I reserved ahead of time, on Open Table, arrived promptly at 11:30.  We were immediately seated and directed to the Brunch buffet.  Breakfast burrito bar, warm tortillas, salsa, grilled onions, jalapenos, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, choice of sausage, and thick sliced bacon....yum!  Also Bananas Foster French Toast, warm, gooey and delicious.  Eggs benedict, pasta marinara, corned beef hash, tossed salad, seasonal salad with fresh strawberries, blue cheese and pecans, fresh baked breakfast breads and muffins, fresh fruit, cereal, milk, yogurt and hardboiled eggs.  This buffet was well worth the $18 charge.  Everything was fresh and delicious, the Bananas Foster French Toast was truly addicting.

...THE BANANA BREAD FRENCH TOAST WAS AMAZING!!

As another reviewer said, this was a reverse commute for me (and it involved getting discombobulated on the subway on a Saturday morning) but it was definitely worth the trip out to the Bloor West Village.

As you can see from above, I had one of the specials - the banana bread french toast (with sausage - also tasty, homestyle). I was also happy the be served a generous portion of real maple syrup with my order (I am a maple syrup snob), but as I turned out I didn't need it - the toast was great without it.

The service was also great - the guy was definitely friendly and attentive - and he was also great at getting the family behind us settled with their small children. The food also came out warm, all at the same time, and  in a timely manner - this is a trifecta I can imagine is difficult to accomplish on a busy Saturday morning for a brunch spot.

I was contacted by CPN and convinced to switch over to them.  I was also told to sell my new processing machine and lease one of theirs through First Data.  I ended up paying almost $1500.00 for a 300.00 machine. When I ended my contract with CPN I found out I had to continue to pay for the processing machine for another year.  The machine is no longer compliant and because I have no contract with CPN any more I am stuck with paying for it. I have been told by CPN that it is first Data's fault and First Data says it is CPN's fault. So I am going to have to pay for another year on a machine that can't be used and despite the contract will not be replaced. I  also was charged too much money for processing through CPN. When I went to end the contract I found out that it is a year longer than a standard processing contract. If I cancelled the penalty was also a lot higher than what most companies charge.

When we dined there, it was severely understaffed; only 4 workers were working the floor, covering all the tables. Some dishes needed to be cooked at the tables so that further limited the service. We had to wait 20+ minutes after sitting down before ordering.

Serving sizes were generous but they were very stingy on the rice. When we asked for more, the waiter let out a large exasperated sigh before complying. Quite unprofessional. When we asked for more water, again with the exasperated sigh. So sorry for inconveniencing you! 

We ordered our dishes with white rice, but when our food was brought out, we got red rice instead. We told them we ordered white, but they said that they were out and red was all they had and left it at that.

You have the option of having meat grilled at your table on a portable stove, which is nice, but after they brought the stove out and lit the fire and poured oil in the pan, they left for around 15 minutes. In addition to the increasingly hot oil that was sitting right in front of us, the pan was leaking oil over the open fire and the table. When this was brought up, they brushed it off saying it was okay. They never cleaned up the oil on our table.

After we finished our meal, we waited quite a while for our check. Eventually, we were fed up with waiting and we got up to go get someone to bring us the check. When the check arrived, we quickly threw in our credit cards and set it to the side of the table (cards sticking out, easily visible) and proceeded to wait another 15 minutes before they came back to pick up the check. After that it was a good 20 minutes before we got our cards back.

On my list of past reviews, you'll find another practice that I tried before changing over to Dr. Jenny and her team. I'm a very sensitive person when it comes to my teeth and I really wanted to find a dentist\/staff that made me feel comfortable and accommodated. I've definitely found what I needed here!

I was able to schedule my first appointment quite easily. The Uptown location is very convenient and parking was validated by the pearl. team, which I appreciated. I was able to do all of my paperwork online which expedited the check-in process.

From the front desk, to the hygienists, to Dr. Jenny herself, everyone I interacted with was phenomenal and kind. At my previous dentist, the hygienist made a very blunt comment about my need for orthodontics (which I'm fully aware of), but at pearl, it was discussed in a much more friendly and approachable way. 

Perhaps my two favorite aspects of the pearl. experience are the TV screens mounted to the ceiling and the complimentary whitening. I was able to watch House Hunters as I got a filling and it made time pass by instantly. After my first appointment, I returned for the complimentary whitening and I was out in about 35-40 minutes. It lasted quite some time before my coffee and tea habit tarnished the results :)

And that's because of the service.

We've been in here about 3 times since it opened, most recently tonight, and the staff is just snarky and rude. You get the sense that they think patrons should be just lucky to eat there. Kinda ruins the whole experience.

First, snark. Then after the rudeness you get to choose - at a walk-up service counter - whether you want to tip? Um, no. I have to admit it takes some skills to be rude in 3-4 different ways in a 2-minute transaction. 

Another poor guy came in after us at 7:50 and the staff person said first thing to him, ""We close in 10 minutes."" Proud of the guy for saying something like ""Can't you pound out a sandwich in 10 minutes?"" I mean, really.

We had the turkey pastrami (pretty good) and a tuna melt that was a one-slice, open-faced melt. It was just ho-hum. The potato salad side was good. I wish the menu would have said they had German potato salad, too, because another staff person came up to us with it in hand to asked if we ordered it. (We hadn't, would have if it were on the menu.)

So the food's decent, they've got a lot of beer, but there's a 2.7% debit card charge. And like most of the other reviewers have said it's expensive, too.

Butternut squash ravioli - overcooked ravioli. When the server came to ask me if my food was ok, I complained that the ravioli was overcooked and not al dente.

Firstly, I ordered the Spicy Beef Soup - they didn't have PBS.  And instead of brisket cut beef, there were less than a dozen slices of bulgogi beef.  Thank you for cheapenin' out, but I know the difference!

The rest of the soup was literally less than a few slices of black mushroom, a few slices of onion, and bam...bean sprouts.  It was pretty spicy, but watery, tasty, but $9.99 for a cheaper cut of meat and bean sprouts?  No, I don't think so.

Also ordered the bulgogi with rice and that was ok.

They wrote $12.99 for the Spicy Beef Soup on the receipt, said it was a mistake, and apologised, so I can only go on their word.  So watch your receipt!

I asked the nice man behind the counter what I should order to eat. He recommended a few things and I went with the cookie, which did have a lavender taste to it, but it wasn't too sweet.

At some places if I ask for a recommendation on what to get they sometimes get annoyed with me or have no answer for me despite knowing their own offerings. Not this place!

We were lured here by a Groupon offer. I hope this critique is viewed by the owners and taken into consideration with this in mind. I love the concept of a waffles and coffee shop. Our coffees and waffles were very tasty and we did enjoy the food (maple bacon and red velvet). However, a place that specializes in waffles really needs more than one regular waffle iron and I would also like to see the option of a Belgian waffle added. Heck there are even waffle irons that make waffles shaped like the state of Texas...that would be a fun addition. Invest in more waffle irons! When ordering coffee to drink in the restaurant it is much, much better served in a glass coffee cup\/mug. The paper plates and very cheap plastic utensils did not provide the best presentation. At the very least try to budget for a better quality of eating utensils. Again- the coffee (an iced snickers coffee, a latte and a cupcake coffee) were all very good, so maybe glass mugs can be added to make them perfect. The atmosphere is okay but I would encourage the addition of some cozier seating and décor...I would have ordered another coffee and stayed longer. I liked the chalkboard wall. The place was a bit cluttered with trash, overflowing trash cans and our table was sticky with dried syrup from what seemed to be days old. There were no pastries in the pastry case which made me sad. The music was too loud at first but was adjusted and included a nice variety of genres. This place has big potential.

Shiro Miso (Kyoto Style) #1 Cha - Su Ramen :
Soybean  paste, pork soup. Topped with Miso pork cha-su 3 pieces, Ground pork, bean sprouts, green onion, corn, fried tofu, men's (bamboo shoots). Topping extra added Miso Flavored Egg... once I started I  didn't come for air

Shoya Ramen... simple and most satisfying. Slice of char-su, seasoned ground pirk, kernels of corn, green onion and thin slightly chewy ramen. 

Japan style Kara-age... Ono delish especially with the generous added garnishings.

The sesame oil bouquet, richness of broth, miso charred edge of the thick char-su, chewy texture of the ramen, under cooked miso whole egg makes you forget about everything that may have happened before the hot bowl sits in front of you. I don't think we experienced that anywhere else.

I called to notify them about the amount of pasole I was given and the fact they forgot the bread. Well the manager, whose name was Joe, told me that ""they over served me the first time I ordered a to go order and that they should have never given me that much to begin with"" then he offers to replace the bread next time I come in. This upset me because I paid almost  $15 dollars for a decent meal and to be given what was probably corners of the pot was ridiculous.

Cycle Technique is a specialty triathlon shop that specializes in tri bikes, apparel, and even swim wear for the seasoned and novice triathlete. No matter what you are into, there is usually something for everyone here. For me, it was a 2 hour drive from Ottawa or a 4 hour+ drive to Toronto. That's a no brainer for me. Shorter the drive the better, I think. I ended up talking to one of the sales staff about me trying to get my foot wet into the triathlon world and he gave me some pointers in what to do and what not to do. That gave me hope for the future, but as I look back on it, triathlon training does take up a lot of time, not to mention more money for race entry fees and bike transport, if you decide on traveling for Iron distance events. I took his advice to heart and thanked him. Who knows what the future would bring, but good things do happen, when you believe in yourself and make it happen out there in training and on race morning. I know that all too well with the marathons and the travels I've done so far.

The overall experience here at Cycle Technique went fairly well. It all started as a way to get my special product that I had been using since late March to gradually lose weight and get back into running (faster) shape, which I already gotten, but the advice mentioned above, was so much better. Not sure what will happen with this advice, but it's always welcome and I've always admire those who've conquered the 70.3 and 140.6 for the first time and beyond. It's just amazing! Cycle Technique is located in the awesome city of Montreal, QC at 788 Avenue Atwater near the city center \/ business district. I was grateful for the street parking right in front of the store, so I did not have to take time and look for some. Timing is everything, sometimes! They accept major credit cards, so that's always a plus. The prices here are competitive, although it can be a little pricey just because they're trying to stay competitive. I bet that the city of Montreal has a very competitive triathlon scene, as well as an active community too.

For the most part, the service here was just touch and go - as far as checking out my purchase. Not much really, except for the advice from the sales guy about triathlon training. They also sell running shoes in the back, but geared for the triathlete. Thought that was pretty cool. Additionally, they do custom bike fittings and bike repairs as well. When I was in the store, a couple came in and brought their bike in for service, so that was cool. It was pretty amazing to see all those brand spanking new triathlon bikes, with famous names ""Cervelo"" leading the pack. Definitely recommend coming here if you are looking to be a triathlete or are a seasoned competitor and are in Montreal, QC. There will be good and bad days during training cycles, but best believe that once you hit that finish line, it's all worth it!

Although they do carry a limited supply of the sports supplements, depending on the brand you use, they may have something there for you too. Everything and anything you could possibly want is here at Cycle Technoque. Come on down and check things out. 4 stars!

I'm usually pretty tolerable about less-than-stellar service, but this place takes it to a new low. I met some fellow Yelpers for our book club meeting. I was there a few minutes later than most of the group so they had drinks already. Our waitress came right over and took my drink order - a water to start. We all started talking about the book so we were a little slow to get a food order together. She came over and asked a few times and we finally ordered. We had probably been there 30 minutes at that point. 

It takes a good while for the food to come out and we don't really get much drink service in the meantime. She might ask one person (they probably had to flag her down) and then would leave without checking with anyone else at the table. I was able to somehow convince her to bring me a pint of Fat Tire. Not sure how that worked out. Although, someone ordered a shot and was brought out not really what he ordered. When the food comes she brings two other people's order, but not mine. I figured she couldn't hold them all or it was a few minutes behind. We don't really see her for another 30 minutes or so. We finally flag her down and I ask her to cancel my order. She looked all surprised and seemed like she tried to blame it on some guy. No apology, no nothing. 

We received crappy service the remainder of our visit. We asked for separate checks and she brought over one long bill. One gal took it up to who we think is the manager and asked it to be split out. We ended up getting separate checks, but my drink and another girl's fries were on the same bill. Really? Ugh. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but was just the gross maraschino cherry on the top of a melted sundae. 

Yeah, the Olympic hockey final was on, but it wasn't busy at all before that and we still had bad service. We determined they don't like blondes. I'll pick a better sports bar before I color my hair. =)

After visiting NWLA's very well-designed website, I was really drawn to this STEM based camp (and preschool). That day I went to see the location. They let me know it was a brand new school and they were finishing up some of the rooms before camp started. And let me tell you...Tracie and Adam were amazing. They are very lovely people with a passion for education and kids. Tracie, the Director, was bubbly and you could just see the drive she had for teaching kids. No kid is created equal, and neither should the teaching methods. She let me know her style of teaching is that she, 'Teaches the kid, not the class.' (Which in a nutshell means, she focuses on each individual and their skill set and what will make them succeed). We just came there for the tour and I really was hooked. Signed my son right up. He ended up going to 2 different - 1 week camps. And let me tell you, my son loved them. Very hands on, and he would tell me what he learned each day. The excitement from him really made me happy. After all that was said and done, not only did he enjoy great educational camps, (not just 'craft time'), I actually moved my son from a previous preschool I already had him signed up for...and signed him up for NWLA instead. I know that the STEM based preschool will be the right environment for my smart, curious, and energetic kid. And he'll even get to start to learn how to read at 4 years old! Amazing.

Sunday to Thursday are the new Friday and Saturday. Come here on any of those nights and you'll fall head over heels for the marvelosity that is Double Deuce. Bold cocktails expertly made with the finest spirits, plus a selection of beer that everyone already loves. The charcuterie plates and other 'finger foods' on offer look wonderful, and were I to visit around dinnertime I'd snatch up a few rounds.  There's a massive vintage marquee that spans the entire westside wall that you'll wish was part of your home decor. The music is essentially a feed into my brain's personal soundtrack (Royksopp, Miike Snow, The Antlers, Mint Royale), the vibe unpretentious, and the bartenders and owners terrifyingly cool and welcoming.

Among the drinks I've tried here (2 oz. cocktails for $12): 
* Chef Cory's Aphrodisiac (Finlandia vodka, Chambord, lemonade), 
* Lavendar Sidecar (Hennessy, Cointreau, lavender honey) 
* Tequila Maggy (El Jimador agave syrup, basil, lemon, soda) 

The New Brunswick Special looks appealing - a bottle of Moosehead with a punch in the face. My brother ordered it but the gorgeous bartender was feelish sheepish and didn't want to punch him right then and there.

I wholeheartedly endorse weeknight visits - on a Friday or Saturday night you'll quickly learn that Double Deuce is no longer Parkdale's best kept secret, and I'll be crowing ""don't say I didn't warn you.""

There was so much meat stacked in the sandwich and mustard on the bread complimented the meat nicely.

Also, beside Schwartz, they had a ""take out"" Schwartz store that let you buy the meat to make your own sandwiches at home! My friends and I bought some of the packed meat to take home. The coolest part of this was that there was a tac board filled with napkins pinned on it with people writing comments about where they're from and what they thought of Schwartz!

This place is usually packed during the summer. The outdoor view is amazing. Everyone is dancing and the music is usually ""bumpin."" Bartenders here are great as well.

FRUWfB-sQXXXPYE3IzqHZw,_JwHRKPVTVui5KOmhmgCMQ,fe8_IsDmaMkfvvVEBnV5nQ,2015-01-28,"This is one of the nicest facilities in town for 24 Hour Fitness 2nd perhaps to the one off Anne Rd. 

The lockers always seem clean to me and the clientele is generally friendly. 

I go here rarely due to the horrendous staff. This is the only front desk where I am ignored more times than not when I come in even when the manager is standing at the front desk. 

Most recently I ran into their Fitness Manager who I believe is Drew. I had no idea who he was. On this particular day he was not wearing anything that would indicate he was an employee let alone a trainer. In fact with his over-sized ""Beast"" cap, baggy clothes and loud conversation about his recent girlfriend and their drama I had wrongly assumed he was just trying to impress the woman he was with. Turns out the woman was his training client. Quite the professional! I personally prefer trainers who are focused on the workout and not their personal life. 

Before he had even introduced himself or I knew who he was I even asked him and his partner if they wanted to work in. Growing up with gyms in NY city I recognize when someone might be interested in the machine I am on and am always happy to oblige. 

Right away I can see that he is agitated I have been on this machine for longer than he wants. I am working up and down the rack and performing a super-set with 3 min rests. I have already been on the machine for about 10 min with 2 sets remaining. This is nothing out of the ordinary. I know some people who can take up a machine for 30 min or more. 

So he comes up to me and tells me hes the Fitness Manager. He doesn't say hello, or tell me his name, he introduces himself as the Fitness Manager and tells me he needs me to finish my set so he can workout his client. At this location the trainers have a designated area that they have specific priority, but on the regular gym floor they have to wait like everyone else or choose to work in. In fact most trainers in my experience will usually just move to another station when one is occupied.

I told him I still have 2 sets remaining. He literally stands behind the machine and starts holding weights in an effort to motivate me off the machine faster. I hate being bullied but I also don't want to ruin a good day at the gym, nor do I want to make his client feel uncomfortable. As I am trying to get my things and move on he doesn't even make the effort to get out of my way so I can leave. He clearly is doing everything possible to make me feel uncomfortable and aware of his aggression. I tell him that he could at least allow me to leave and his response is simply ""Don't talk to me now""!. 

I spent another hour and a half at the gym that day finishing my workout. I fully expected to hear back from that ""Manager"" in a more conciliatory tone after he was done with his client, but of course that never happened. 

24 Hours is recently under new management from my understanding and I hope they make the effort to prioritize customer service. I am happy to work out at a nice facility and just be ignored most of the time but when their staff goes out of their way to be hostile that's a reason to cancel and just move on.

I had to be the girl to point out there was no ice in the soda fountain but she was more than happy to hop up there and put more in.

Pros - We were seated at our table within 5 minutes in the upstairs dining area. The atmosphere was buzzing on a Saturday night. Our server was highly knowledgable about the cuts of beef and was very helpful with us for recommendations. The meal was as expected with the beef of the high quality and flavour. 

Cons - Service staff had a couple of hiccups with our drink orders and seemed confused at who was to clear the table\/ refill our drink order but it was a minimal disruption to our meal.

First of all, the ambiance is not that great. Lots of small, loud children. 

The service was very average. We had three servers ask us if we had been helped yet, which I suppose is a good thing, but they all seemed very confused and not sure if we were their table. But good that they asked. Our actual server took quite a while to greet us, and of course he forgot my water. Brought the beer though! 

We started with wings and we wanted to split them...two flavors. At first he told us we couldn't do that, even though it says right on the menu that you can. He made it seem as though he was doing us a favor by splitting them for us! They tasted more like chicken fingers and not wings. Way too much breading. 

I had the California burger, hubby had the fish and chips. The burger was overdone, but I expected it would be so I ordered it medium to get it to medium well. It was well done. Thankfully I didn't order well done! Otherwise it wasn't bad for this kind of place. I also order the potato chips as a side since they make them there. The chips were burnt.  The fish was seriously over breaded (apparently they like doing that here) and way too big. The baked potato and cole slaw...very average. 

Now all that being said.....our bill was very cheap ($33) and that included two beers, wings, and two entrees.

We ordered the gyoza and green tea smoothie to share. I had the Ji Su Men and my boyfriend ordered The King of Kings. The gyoza was packed with flavour and each dumpling was very generously filled. I will definitely order this dish every time I come here. It's really that good! The green tea smoothie although delicious was not worth the $4.95. It came in a very small glass whereas the photo that was advertising the drink was in a glass twice the size that was actually delivered to me. I was pretty disappointed and I don't recommend ordering this drink. 

I had better luck with my ramen thankfully. The Ji Su Men had a broth that was rich and thick thanks to the egg and the noodles were perfect. The portion was pretty big, in fact sharing a bowl probably would have been more than enough especially after filling up on gyoza. I had a few sips of the King of Kings.

Then on the weekend I saw this Yelp listing, and will admit that when I see nothing but 1 and 5 star reviews, I'm immediately skeptical. But that actually only further inspired my need to check the place out. 

What I can say, is that I had a good experience overall. While I did some some questionably priced items, I also found some well priced items. I mean its hard to even give you an average of what to expect as I saw records ranging from $5 to $125. The 4 records I bought came to about $30. All records had been fitted within plastic sleeve protectors which is a nice touch in helping preserve their quality. 

The bulk of the selections making up the place are 12"" releases. One thing I can confirm is that this is not the place to go for hip hop, as there was literally only half a crate to pick through and most was pretty shit. Also if you collect 45s, options are limited as they only had 1 box of assorted 7 inches. There was a lot of rock and jazz albums from what I could see, and about half a dozen crates of funk\/soul\/disco as well.

We picked Vic & Anthony's based on their yelp reviews and availability on a Friday night (during a fight weekend).  We were sat right away and our server Annette was funny, curteous, and most importantly put up with our motley crew.  The sommelier on site was great too.

I am a loyal customer and have always been pleased with my services, the friendly staff and management. I went in today, to get my acrylic nails removed and have gels put on. As soon as I sat down I informed the nail tech I wanted him to soak my nails instead of attempting to rip the acrylics off (I have done this before and it has been painful and would have rather sat for longer than be in pain. He disregarded what I asked and after he hurt me twice, I firmly said, ""I need you to soak my nails."" It took them forever. The man ended up going to the back and  a woman took over.

I ended up getting a pedicure, at the woman's suggestion, while I uncomfortably soaked my nails in a single bowl of acetone. The pedicure was rushed because three walk-ins arrived right after she started the pedicure process and there were only two people working, including the lady that was doing my pedicure. When she went to put on the temporary flip flops, she wiped off some of the paint on my big toe. She painted over it quickly which left a bump of paint on my toe. 

After my pedicure, she proceeded to take off my nails, I told her I no longer wanted to get the gel manicure because I didn't have time. From then on her whole demeanor changed, she rushed getting my acrylics taken off, didn't file them down (they are completely uneven and there was even hanging nails) and asked me to pay. I told her my displeasure how I have never had an experience like this. I handed her my card as I was telling her, she slid it and I told her This is a service I wouldn't pay for, I could've done this myself. She told me she wouldn't charge my card and cancelled the transaction. I later got a notification of my card being charged $37 (for the nail removal and pedicure). I called Iimmediately. I told her I wanted to speak to the manager (who previously was Trisha; I was speaking to the new manager Kathy), that my card shouldn't have been charged and I want a refund. She responded by saying, ""I don't have money to refund you, I just spent all that time with you."" I told her that she charged my card without authorization, and she said ""You come back In and I fix for you."" I responded by saying I don't have time to come back in for you to fix it, nor will I come back in and have you mediocrely ""fix"" my nails which you ruined in the first place. She apologized and said ""Happy New Year"" as I told her I woll be disputing the charge with my bank. Save yourself the time, don't come here. In 2015 it was wonderful, but the new management has ruined it, not mention they charge cards when they said they wouldn't.

I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime, with my last visit being last night.  Most patrons appear to be late 20's\/early 30's to older patrons in the late 40's\/early 50's as well as some college students here and there.  The restaurant itself is pretty cramped and ridiculously loud.  Tables are close together and patrons are all basically shouting to talk to each other or awkwardly sitting in silence.  I'm a loud guy who's at college and loud noises typically don't bother me, but something about the acoustics of the room... noises just bounce around instead of getting absorbed and the metal tables don't help either.  Anyways, on with the food.

Their menu is seasonal with slight changes in their pasta throughout the year.  Everyday they have a fresh poultry, a fresh fish, and a fresh meat of the day.  Their fresh fish was a grilled mako shark, but alas they were out for the night already (we got there before 6:30 PM).  All entrees come with a choice of soup or salad.  I ended up ordering their house ribeye medium rare along with a cup of their wedding soup.

While we waited, we munched on bread from their bread basket.  Butter comes with the bread, but they also have balsamic and olive oil at each table too.

The wedding soup was pretty good; it wasn't overly salty and there was a reasonably amount of sausage.  I picked soup over their salad because my past experience with their salads are that they are swimming in dressing and I don't like my salads soggy.

The ribeye came topped with a pesto, diced tomatoes and served with roasted potatoes.  It was cooked to medium as opposed to medium rare, but for a steak under $30 bucks I'm not going to make a big deal out of it.  The pesto was flavorful but the roasted potatoes were a bit overcooked.  The steak itself had a beautiful char and cooked well as a medium steak.

I've had their pasta in the past and they're of pretty good quality and cooked perfectly, but the portions have gotten smaller over time and I don't think the $3-5 dollar upcharge from the lunch menu is really worth it for dinner anymore.

I would probably recommend Lydia's over Girasole, but it might be worth a shot for lunch when it won't be as loud and there probably wouldn't be a wait either.",2,0,0,"""Girasole Restaurant""",Shadyside,"""733 Copeland St""",Pittsburgh,PA,15232,40.4511949,-79.9346096,4.0,293,1,Italian;Restaurants

Growing up I was always given advice like, ""you drink lots of milk and you wont be fat.""  She always had food cooking, and the smells of her house were so unique.  My favorite thing about Vietnamese mothers is that they dote on their children while complaining.  I was always spending the night at her house, and when I would wake up, my clothes from the night before would be washed, starched, ironed (including my undies,) and everything would be folded in individual ziplock baggies.  Meanwhile we would get yelled at that she was always having to work hard to take care of us, and lord help her husband if he made her mad.  I swear Vietnamese mothers are awesome!

Any who, this lady is just as cool.  My first visit here was with a friend who lives down the street and recommended it.  We ordered it to go and were told it would take about 20 minutes.  So, we went and had a beer (or 3) at the dive bar in the same shopping complex and we went back minutes before the closing time.  As we walked it, it felt like a blast from the past.  The little old lady was complaining ""you order too much soup!  I had to make more soup because you order too much soup!""  ""Oh, I so tired!"" ""I make SO much soup today!"" I knew right there that I was going to love this place. 

The Chicken Pho comes in separate containers to keep the herbs fresh.  The chicken is separate from the broth and you get to mix it all together according to your like.  I usually can not eat all of it in 1 sitting.  The Goi Cuon, pork and shrimp salad rolls are delicious (I order an extra peanut sauce to dip.)  The fried spring rolls are good too (although the sauce that comes with them I don't like,) and I have had the fried rice and it is delicious and moist.

The crab puffs aren't very good, I wont ever order those again, but everything else I have ventured to try has been delicious.

Pho ranges in price from around $6.50-7.50, most Chinese meal combos are $8.50, and I think the salad rolls are around $6. 

The little old lady doesn't always complain at her customers, and when she does she isn't mean.  One time I went in, and she was complaining about her new waitress.  Telling me how hard it is to train ""new help.""  She will get over it fast and she will give you a genuine smile as you leave.  This is a locally owned Mom and Pop restaurant in a strip mall.  No frills, but they have been here for a while and seem to genuinely appreciate your business, even if they do complain a little.  We really did order too much soup.

Because of numerous dental problems, I have seen many many dentists over the years and by far, Dr. Sandhu is THE BEST!   He has a calm demeanor and is an excellent listener.  He's committed to resolving all dental issues and makes sure that I feel comfortable with any future plans.  He's simply wonderful, very kind and VERY patient.  Trust me, I'm a difficult patient :)  So far, I've been most impressed with the 3D crowns he ""prints"" while ""you wait!""  It was such a cool experience that I took photos of the crown he created for me before it was inserted.  

The dental hygienists are very well trained and have been working for 10+ years.  I especially enjoy the ""education"" I receive while having my teeth cleaned. Casia, the front office manager, works hard to fit in dental emergencies and has been so understanding when I've had to reschedule an appointment.  She goes above and beyond -always- and I genuinely appreciate all she has done for me.  She was so understanding when I needed a crown but wasn't financially prepared to pay for it, and helped me set up a finance plan over 6-9 months.  

Let's be honest, no one really looks forward to going to the dentist, but I honestly do look forward to seeing Casian, the dental techs and Dr. Sandhu.

I've visited Anthony's Pizza in Monroeville, PA  twice now. Once by myself and the second trip today I took my mother. Both experiences were excellent.
The pizza here is absolutely delicious. I've had almost every pizza in Pittsburgh as well as the worlds greatest pizza's in NYC (I am a huge pizza freak). I absolutely love the pizza here. Neither time was it ""overcooked"" or burned. It was charred perfectly with a black crust without having a bad taste or anything. I got a single topping both times and it was fantastic, my mother also loved it! Just be aware with any pizza place, the more toppings you load on, the harder it is to cook a pizza right. Maybe others pile theirs up which is why they come out bad?

Besides the pizza, the wings here are amazing. Perfect, homemade chicken wings. Not hard or chewy, great taste, very tender. Probably the best wings in the Pittsburgh area. it's worth coming here for the wings alone! We also got their cheesecake which my mother loved (I haven't tried it yet but I took some home).
Lastly besides the food, the service is great. The first time I visited they let me sample several beers for free and even gave me some wings to try. The waiter was great. The second trip the service was still great. The place was packed but we got our food in under 25 minutes. Excellent waiters and plenty of staff keeping the place moving.

Great food, atmosphere is nice with a very beautiful restaurant for a pizza place. The only reason I have to complain and dock a star from my rating for; the price. The prices here are ridiculous.The bill for two people came to $46. They charged me $6 for a beer and $10 for two slices of cheesecake. The pizza is pricey as well. The large pizza with a mushroom topping came to $18.70. They have no medium sized pizza (which is strange) and the large pizza I got looked like a medium you would get anywhere else. It felt like the bill should have been $35, not $46 (not including the tip even). If you're going for two (or on a date with someone) I recommend just the pizza and a couple soft drinks to not break the bank. And if you have a smartphone, go on fourquare, you can get a coupon on your phone for two free wings to sample. 
Other than the price, highly recommend this place. I think it's a very appropriate place when you want to take someone special out for pizza but to somewhere nicer besides a bar\/chain restaurant.

I was not let down 
We started the evening with the flat bread and the pulled duck coleslaw
I thought the flat bread was really good but a tad too salty even for me (I love salt) . 
The pulled duck coleslaw was outstanding and fresh. It sits on a celery-rave and apple purée that wasn't too overpowering so i liked it a lot. 
We had the beef onglet and chicken as main courses. 
Both were really good. I love acidic flavors and I felt like they used lots of it for both plate.
We had one desert to share because we were pretty full: a chocolate waffle with ice cream and pecans.
It was ok nothing to die over. 
But I'm not crazy about chocolate so don't take my word for it. 
We had wine by the glass. Good selection.
Service was ok and effective 
The restaurant is really small and the tables are really close to each other.

I was happy about the quick response time, since there have been other companies who haven't even contacted me since the show; that promised they would.

Once removed from the water, they were slung on a long plank, dusted with sesame seeds or seasonings and put into the oven.

Sometimes I have too, but East side Vietnamese food (albeit somewhat Americanized) is rare and makes a nice change. There are vegetarian options, and for good prices ($11-$12 for a decent portion). BUT: The items on the extensive vegetarian menu are NOT all vegetarian. Good luck figuring out which ones are: I got a lot of lies and dismissals and contradictory answers from different people (wait staff and by phone) simply because they didn't want to go back to the kitchen and ask which ones have no fish sauce--or because even in the kitchen, they have no idea.

SERVICE

After multiple visits over six months or so, I can say it has been consistently friendly, but consistently poor: inefficient, and many mistakes. So many wrong dishes, my guests eventually gave up and just ate the mistakes.

 But the WORST thing--unforgivable in food service--is the lack of knowledge about their own dishes, and complete lack of interest in finding out the answers. Aside from vegetarians, we had people with food allergies. That's serious business! Again and again our server thought ""I don't know"" and ""probably"" were sufficient answers. Her smile faltered when pressed for real info--she didn't want to be bothered. (How could these questions not come up every single day? Do most people accept ""maybe"" as an answer about ingredients?)

In the end I was told, regarding some ""vegetarian"" dishes: ""just don't eat the sauce, it's on the side."" As though a) I should have known psychically that this particular ""vegetarian"" dish had a meat-based sauce AND that it came on the side, and as though b) being charged full price for a sauceless, flavorless meal mis-labeled vegetarian on the menu is an acceptable alternative I should be lucky to get. I didn't get one of those dishes, needless to say.

If you're not going to cater to vegetarians, then don't pretend to. The same concern applies to any questions about the food. Stay away if you have any intolerances or disliking for certain ingredients.

ATMOSPHERE

Nice inside (modern) but quite brightly lit, and the 4 sports TVs behind the bar are out of place and distracting (but thankfully silent). The place is maybe half full at the dinner hour on weekend, and cleared out almost completely after that, so if you don't want crowds and bustle, it's worth a look.

FOOD

Average quality, acceptable for the price. But some dishes are TOTALLY different from the menu.

ALWAYS ask whether a dish is exactly like the menu describes, or something else. Example--the Pineapple Chicken:

I came with a diabetic who specifically did not want her meat breaded in carbs. Some dishes specify breading; some--like the Pineapple Chicken--don't, so she ordered that. It was explicitly stated in the menu as chicken served in a half-pineapple. Sounds fun, right? And she loves pineapple. Well, what arrived was very ordinary Chinese takeout, except for lemon in the sauce which was good and unusual. It was breaded, and it was NOT served in a pineapple; in fact it had just a couple tiny pieces of what might have been canned pineapple. Totally false advertising.

I don't know why they would change the menu when they renovated this place.  Totally different menu, they got rid of their home made French fries and the meals don't include the sides as before.  

The only good comment I have is that the Goulash soup was ok this time but literally half the portion this time.  The Schnitzel is still a nice size but now only one piece and with no salads.  Mashed potatoes have no flavour unless you put the dill butter that comes with your bread.

Made me sad that they made such a drastic change to this place so my last 5 star review is now a 2 star.",2,0,0,"""Schnitzel Hub""",,"""100 Steeles Avenue W, Unit 17""",Vaughan,ON,L4J 7Y2,43.7982121768,-79.4253806455,3.5,47,0,Modern European;Restaurants;Austrian;German;Food

Free coffee, donuts, wifi, comfy chairs.  Would love to give five stars, but I wouldn't say the service is the speediest.  I waited over an hour for a routine oil change as the first appointment.  And they really should post the service advisors names on the outside entrance next to lane numbers. I am always in the wrong lane when I check in. Both minor inconveniences in the scheme of things.

Not so much today though.
Server was ok but advised someone else would be making my egg cream because she really doesn't make them well. I was 3\/4 done with my sandwich when the egg cream came.. tI was not the best. 
I always order a pastrami sandwich with coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye... this time the  pastrami was under cooked... coleslaw almost non existent . very disappointing.
My husband ordered a roast beef sandwich that came very dry and over cooked.
The table next to us with 4 diners, up and left due to the fact that no one came to take their order.

There will be a wait, especially at night, but it is so worth it.  You will be seated directly across from the Bellagio, so I'm not sure what's better than enjoying amazing food while watching their fountain show. 

On this past long weekend trip to Vegas, I actually ate at Mon Ami Gabi twice in almost as many days.  My girlfriends and I went for dinner on a weeknight, and even for indoor seating had about a 30 minute wait.  But, totally worth it.  This was my first time eating dinner here, and let me tell you--it was delicious!  I opted for one of their Prime Steak Frites--the Au Poivre, which is with brandy peppercorn sauce.  The beef was delicious and tender, and the brandy peppercorn sauce was divine.  The beef had been pounded very long and thin, but man my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  Instead of frites, our waiter informed me I could have mashed potatoes--get the mashed potatoes!  Oh so buttery and delicious. 

I was also impressed with the bread that came with the meals.  They served the bread with shredded carrots marinated in something, and as odd as it sounds, it was absolutely delicious on the bread!  My two girlfriends also enjoyed their meals--one also had a Prime Steak Frites and another had the caramelized sea scallops. 

Two days later, my brother picked me up for breakfast, and this is always his first choice as to where to go on the Strip.  I've been several times prior for breakfast, and have always enjoyed it.   This time, I enjoyed the french toast and instead of blueberries opted for strawberries.  Delicious!

Normally I just suck it up since it's too much of a pain after going through the drive thru to go back to the restaurant to say anything.

I started to explain the problem to him and, after a minute, he cuts me off to call on a female manager to come over an told her to take care of it.  I then start to explain it to her and she also cuts me off and defends the food saying she doesn't know how it's possible the food wasn't fresh because they've been so busy all night and the food has been flying off the shelf.  I was already reluctant to say anything and now I feel like I'm being shamed or called a liar which made me extremely uncomfortable.

Top Regret: sit-in (more than double the price!)

We were thirsty, craving something sweet, and knew from prior experience that Chatime had insane lineups around this time. We looked elsewhere in the plaza, and voila, Tea Shop 168.

A few years ago, Tea Shop 168 seemed like the king of bubble tea. How much has changed now. It was like a ghost town on a Sunday afternoon around 3 pm - completely empty. And while I was glad there was no line up (the previous week, we waited nearly ten minutes in line at Chatime), it was also a moment where you go ""but is there a reason nobody is here...?""

We did not hang out here, but it actually looked very comfortable, with spacious tables and seating... I imagine they get filled up more on say, a Friday night.

In my few times here, I did find that the fruit drinks seem extremely ""powder""-based, which is a turn off (except the bananas... they had a lot of those on the counter!). However, their regular milk tea - you can't really go wrong with that, especially for the $1.99 takeout special.

I brought a Sony A7R into Morris' shop that I had bought used online. When I got it, the sensor was really contaminated with some caked-on stuff; and I was pretty upset and sure I would be returning it. I surely didn't want to mess with it.

Well, Morris looked at it, and he said....hmmmmmmm. The same kind of hmmmmmm that a Doctor says when he sees something that's not quite right at all, but doesn't want to tell you. We both thought the sensor was thrashed. (Editorial note: it bugs me when people don't take care of nice gear.)

Well I left it with Morris for about an hour, and he was able to clean the sensor; so camera all good to go! (Whew!)

Thanks, Morris!

BTW, yes, the signage is lacking, but the talent isn't. Also a bit hard to get to the right building (about three deep off the street). As a side note, he's got some GREAT shots on his walls and it was good fun to chat about shooting and Canon gear and and other lenses.

Started buying all of my produce here after a serious decline in quality at my neighborhood Frys. 

Have yet to see any rotting produce. Everything is organized and easy to find, which is kind of hard to mess up in the first place seeing as it's a smaller grocery store. 

You go into these types of stores expecting to pay an arm and a leg. Well, not at Sprouts. Organics for the same price as regular Frys produce? Done!  And as much as I love Whole Foods, Sprouts is by far more affordable for essentially the same items. 

The vitamin and supplement selection is insane, and associates are knowledgeable, and more than happy to assist you in finding what you need. MSM, Niacinamide and Traumeel all the way for Rosacea management . . . Screw your antibiotics, dermatologists. 

Love the abundance of bulk. Spices, snacks, you name it. So far, have only stopped in for quinoa and flaxseed. 

Can we also talk about the ambiance in here? Haha, how often do you hear THAT word in a grocery store review?! Not a whole lot of Southeast Valley douchebaggery to be seen...yet. Everyone always seems to be in a pleasant mood. It's like a little slice of Northern Colorado in Chandler.

I was in a MVA when the tour bus collided with another vehicle last fall in Toronto. My wife's little brother, visiting from Jamaica, sustained two fractures to his leg and a couple to his hip . Very traumatic experience for me so I knew it was even worst for him.
At first their insurance company seemed helpful assisting with immediate costs and paying a bunch my medical expenses for him. But as the months went on they seemed more and more reluctant to take care of his rehab. I felt a bit guilty, as I had been the one to encourage him yo come to the States and then to Canada with us, and angry. The tour company (cannot name for legal purposes) was insured for these kinda of things and yet the insurance was acting as if we were at fault for being victims.
 I called and spoke with Sandra who talked me through the experience and what is possible even though we're no longer in Canada. Her support staff helped me with the forms to send to my wife's brother and she immediately sent a letter to the insurance company to let them know he was being represented by her. None of thought to sue in the beginning, as accidents happen, but as the bills started to pile up and he couldn't pay, we all knew he would have to in order to get him back to his feet.
The insurance company backed down and I knew hehad a great firm behind him. Being in another country didn't seem to slow them down. Everytime he needed something they would get back to him within a few hours.By the time he got the settlement it was around what the cost of his physio rehab was.
I for one was happy to see him back on his feet, literally lol. He was never seeking more just what they promised in the beginning.

-Each dishes were not heavily seasoned which allowed the natural flavors of the combined ingredients to shine. The flow of all the courses made sense: from light to heavy. 
-Food was really good. Only complain is the rhum cake. The cake was incredibly soggy as the server was too heavy-handed on the rum.

SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE. 
She was condescending and rude toward our table. She essentially treated us as kids. Maybe she had a bad day, but trust me, I was a server previously and I would never treat the customers in such disrespectfully manner. Why? Because the server's performance at the front will overall affect the restaurant's reputation. 

She promised to provide us the menu of the tasting menu, however after multiple follow ups, it has been more than 1 month and no menu provided. 

The bill & payment issue was a mess. For example: the bill was $100, my friend paid $150 cash. The server gave my friend $150 with the $50 bill broken down... How does that even make any sense? She explained that she didn't want to assume tips.

Even the plain bittersweet chocolate was disappointing--there was no substance or complexity at all.

I had to wait for a short time because she forgot to clean the room after her client before me.

Before waxing my brows, she asked how thick I wanted my brows, when was the last time I got it done, & if I wanted an arch or not. They use a soft wax & the temperature was perfect. You don't even feel the wax being applied to your skin until she puts the paper on top of it then you notice something's there. She started out just cleaning my brows and then asked if the shape was alright. We agreed that it would look better if it was a little thinner so the arch would show more & she did just that. I left satisfied with my brows not only because of how it looked, but my skin wasn't as bumpy and red as it usually is when I get my brows waxed.

For the master aesthetician, you will pay $25.

Simply put this is my spot, even if a movie is boring you'll be tempted to close your eyes and take a short nap, I'm not saying you should do that but I think it makes my point across that the seats are amazingly comfortable.

This is how more movie theaters across the country should adopt. Reserved Seating!!!

For popular movies go on-line and reserve your seat and pick up your tickets at a kiosk in less then 30seconds.

I usually skip the concession stand but they have wine\/beer in addition to popcorn\/soda\/candy.

On Saturday we finally made it, and I wish that we hadn't waited as long as we did.  This restaurant was fantastic, and far exceeded my expectations.  I am always skeptical of restaurants in this price point, especially when you assume that you may be just ""paying for the view"".  Not true at all.  The food at Different Pointe of View can stand up to the creativity and quality of any other high end restaurant in town.  I had the Port Cabernet Braised Kobe Short Rib: Fresh Sweet Corn Polenta, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Endamame & Blue Berry Balsamic Reduction as an appetizer.  It was delicious and unique, and my only complaint was that there was not more of it.  My wife had the lobster bisque with Heirloom Cauliflower & Lobster Timbale, it too was remarkable, but I was glad that I got the short rib.  For entrees I had the Cedar River Prime New York Strip: Pancetta Chervil Rosti Potato, Braised Artichoke Heart & Portabellas Sherry Caramelized Onion Reduction.  There was a lot going on in this dish, and I appreciated every bit of it.  The steak was perfect and the carmelized onion reduction was incredible.  My wife had the Palo Verde Farms Pork Tenderloin with Chorizo Stuffing: Piquillo Pepper Parmesan Risotto, Sweet Corn & Baby Zucchini Succotash, Caramelized Tree Ripened Peach & White Balsamic Olive Oil Emulsion.  This had a ton of flavor and she loved it.  The risotto was really my favorite part of the dish, but the pork was excellent.

I don't know if it was because my dad (who had bought several vehicles from here in the past) was with me or if it was because they are a genuinely good dealer...if there is such a thing.  

Anyway i came in with about 14K to spend between pre approved loan and cash in hand and was looking for a newer car with low mileage.  we walked around the lot for a few minutes without finding anyone outside so we went in and were helped by Scot (can't remember his last name).  He was extremely patient with my readily stated skepticism of car dealers based on prior experience and  allowed me to test drive a couple of cars with no questions asked or paperwork.  I asked every question I could think of about the car i was serious about buying and he was patient and professional in answering everything.  I even got a free carfax and he laughed when i told him another dealer was trying to charge $75 for it.  ""thats not how we do business here"" he stated.  When we went inside to fill out the paperwork he asked if i would like to fill out a loan application to which I replied ""I have one already but if you wanna try and compete knock yourself out"".  

He came back with a loan that carried almost a full percent lower interest rate than the loan I walked in the door with along with the same terms
-no early payment or payoff fee
-allowed pay months in advance and skip other months (as long as the loan was on schedule)
-no origination fee

I was very impressed and signed on the dotted line.  I was very happy with the service I received but took off a star because we had to initiate contact (which may have been because it was extremely cold out), and I would have liked to have recieved something in writing that said the service dept was by appointment only.  Im sure I was told this and forgot, but to have it on a business card for the service dept would have been a nice touch.  Not a big deal but for my money its the little extras that get you the coveted 5 star review,  and they only put half a tank of gas in it for me.  I don't know if you only get a full tank when purchasing a new vehicle (mine is a 2012); and it wouldn't have been a big deal except I had just got done filling up my old car right before selling it so I was kind of out $30 thinking that when you bought from a dealer it was standard practice to get a full tank of gas when you left the lot.  Not a big deal in the big scheme of things but maybe i should have asked instead of assumed.  ( would actually give this place 4 1\/3 stars because I think taking off a full star is a bit much but cant give fractional stars).

We let them know so they could sanitize for future dogs who may be boarded there. Following the 3rd boarding, our dog got a severe bacterial skin infection around his genital area. He wasn't eating and the vet bill was over 600 (included x rays to check stomach since not eating before discovered infection). Our vet said it was lack of appropriate sanitation procedures that caused this type of infection. She said she will never refer any of her patients to Pet Paradise again. FYI we contacted Pet Paradise to let them know of this situation and to request a refund of just the last boarding fee since their poor sanitation caused this infection and vet bill. But they would not refund our money and stated that everyone signs a form stating they are not responsible for any injuries or illnesses that may occur.

I immediately called the first bee removal outfit I found on the internet.  A young man arrived shortly after my call and I foolishly said to do what ever has to be done.  

I was still in a panicky shock-like state of mind when I signed two contracts and two checks, one for bee and honey removal $645 and one for roof repairs $745!  After realizing my error, I called the company in an attempt to negotiate the price.  I was told it was too late.  They already had my signature.  So I stopped payment on the checks and later sent a money order for $645 plus check charge of $12 noting that this was payment in full for all work done by them.  They responded with threats. I am really upset and feel I have already paid them way too much.

I feel that $1390 was a tad bit high for the removal of honeycombs located under the roof tile of my one story home.  It took the young man about an hour to complete the job. 

I can't help but wonder if this senior woman was taken advantage of.  A couple of roof tiles were removed and replaced for the whopping price of $745!  A day after the job was  done, I was told by my yard maintenance man that there were no bees at his last visit and there was no way so much honey could have been made in that short amount of time.

Like services from other companies range from $150 to 350.

FL2-I_dZF0dGtpgkDqNUjw,dvXn4fiE6z2dgKSvIO2wXg,Yk8WiriuHOkAXufUqGZMyg,2010-05-09,"Edit (3\/11\/2011):  I knocked one star off my earlier review.  The last few times I've gone to this Culver's, the food has been hit or miss.  I've tried something new each time (from burgers to chicken salad sandwiches to fried chicken, etc), and half the time I get a great entree.  The other half of the time I get an uber-greasy or bland item.  The custard, though, is always consistently good.  The so-so food plus yummy custard = 3 stars.

My first review:

Culver's is awesome!  My family goes about twice a month.  We have young children, and find Culver's to be pretty kid-friendly.  It's both a fast food place and a frozen custard shop.  As for the custard, it is so creamy, rich, and delicious!  They offer chocolate, vanilla, and a flavor of the day.  You have some options like regular scoops, sundaes, shakes, cakes, cookie sandwiches, and blizzard-type thingies.  Then there's the crazy food menu that has tons of stuff like ""butter burgers"", crinkle fries, fish n chips, fried shrimp, roast beef or fried chicken dinners with sides, hot sandwiches, pork cutlet sandwiches (like a schnitzel sandwich), soups, salads, and more!  Cah-ray-zee!  Not only is the food pretty good, but the seating area is nice and clean, more like eating at a Panera or a Paradise Bakery than at a McDonalds, if you know what i mean.  They have flat panel TVs on the walls (showing news or sports) and an outdoor patio.  You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring your hot, fresh food out to your table fairly quickly.  All this, plus they have a drive-thru!  How they can offer all of their menu items, get them out quickly, and offer them in a drive-thru is beyond me, but they do it!!  DOUBLE CRAZY!

I only have three minor issues\/complaints, if you can really call them that.  1) that they are almost always BUSY when we're there, but that's not really a complaint. :)  , 2) for being such a busy place, they don't seem to have enough seating,  and 3) the drink fountain:  It is in such a cramped, high traffic spot in the restaurant, that it often has a group of people waiting to fill up or just trying to get by.  The back-up of people might also be due to the actual fountain being really overly fizzy (i.e. People try to fill their cup and end up with half bubbles, so they spend extra time at the drink station dumping the top half and refilling several times.)  That's happened consistently each time I've gone.

Overall, a very clean, casual, and reasonably priced place to bring the family for dinner and dessert.",0,0,0,"""Culver's""",,"""1825 W Deer Valley Dr""",Phoenix,AZ,85027,33.6831904911,-112.097922218,3.5,118,1,Restaurants;Burgers;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Fast Food;Food

I came into the shop and went straight to the amazing selection of macarons to the left. They were gorgeous and it wasn't long before someone came to help me. I got one of each of the 12 flavours they had at $1.95 which is not a bad price for them considering I have paid up to $2.75 each before. The cute gold box they had awkwardly was big enough for 16 macarons and due to my slight OCD I had to get the 16 which came up to $31.20.

Oh my goodness, my first bite of the passionfruit macaron was soo good. I didn't eat the entire box in one sitting but I really wanted to. I didn't care much for guava and the rose water one tasted like soap to me :( I got it just to try it but I regret that decision. I'm guessing rose water is an acquired taste that I don't have.

But so many people stick to the strip for the food. There is so much great food in Vegas and it's only a $10 cab ride away. Chang's is one of these diamonds.

If you are a fan of Dim Sum, you have to check out Chang's on a Sat or Sun morning; Sunday being the most popular day of course. The sticky pork buns (Char siu baau) was perfect. Not too sweet like some others I've had, but with a great mix of salty pork, BBQ flavor, and honey. Great Hangover food.

Their Lotus Leaf Rice (Lo mai gai) was also one of the best I have ever had (best as in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas) with the flavor being subtle but delicious. Finally, the Rice Congee (rice porridge) was good enough that I had two bowls. One was ""plain"" and the other I added a small bit of the spicy red paste.

Since business slows down in the wee hours of the morning, they close off half the club to make it half with people in it seem more crowded.  As the other reviewers have stated, there are some girls that are hot, not so hot, and some that should probably have retired a few years ago.  Drinks here are definitely pricey as a beer was $12 and a Grey Goose and Redbull was $21.  WTF, how much?  I realized it was because they charge you for the Red Bull in addition to the vodka.  I guess they figure if you're not going to get a lapdance and just drink, they'll stick it to you that way - either way, the strip club or the stripper will rob you of your cash that night.

My buddy ended up getting a dance from this really nice dancer, I mean personality-wise, as she was a local and we were talking about what locals do in Vegas as they were both locals.

Needless to say, they don't have tires! Are you freaking kidding me! A tire store that does not have tires. That should have been my clue to leave. Anyways the staff tells me they can get tires (USED) from the other store and have new tires in approx. one week. So, I agree with the used tires. Needless to say one month later, still no tires and the manager will not return my phone calls. The only person that answers the phone is ""Jessica"". 

The story does not stop there, The staff also did not install the tire sensors and the store refuses to accept that they did not install them. So, I go to the other store and the manager of the store happened to assist me. I explain to him that the tire sensor monitor in my vehicle is not reading the tires sensors. The manager brings out this small black box and states that maybe the sensors were not cloned. The manager checks the wheels and tells me that the sensors were never installed.

They have probably the best happy hour I have ever seen that lasts from 3pm-7pm then 9pm-Close, and is SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. The HH menu includes single pieces of sushi for $0.99, rolls for $3, and a variety of other fried appetizers for a few bucks (including fried tofu and vegetable dumplings that are vegan friendly) in addition to a ton of cheap ass booze. You can get a sake bomber with Kirin\/Kirin Light for $3.85. Beers (domestic and import) are under $2, cocktails are $5, and they even have scorpion bowls!

The staff has been very friendly and quick to answer questions, and the service is always quick. 

The decor is totally funky inside, which I personally like. it has a lot of character. They also have a really nice patio that is great for beautiful days and day drinking!

Their regular menu is really expansive and I've only had the kung pao tofu, but it was really good. 

They have free delivery with a $25 minimum, but only specific hours. M-F 11a-3p\/5p-8p and Sat\/Sun 12-8p. You can fax or email your order in too, which I think is pretty cool. Delivery is from 16th ave - 48th street, Broadway to Dobbins.

I had never been to a Brazilian steakhouse before, so I was excited at the chance to check this place out. We got there before they opened, but they still let us come inside and wait in the A\/C until they were ready to go. There were a lot of people waiting to be seated, but we still got to our table quickly and our servers were very patient and friendly as we waited for the rest of our group to get there. One of them offered us some recommendations on the drink menu, and educated us about some of the food items we would be offered as well.
Once everyone arrived, we walked over to the salad bar which had a ton of great options! There were many different vegetables, soups, salads, and other sides. Among the options, some of the things I chose were lobster bisque, asparagus, mushroom salad, roasted peppers, shrimp, smoked salmon, quinoa and squash. I got very small samples of the sides, knowing that there was still a lot of food to come. After we sat back down at the table, we were told to flip our cards over to green whenever we were ready for the different meats. Once you do that, there is a parade of large skewers being brought around by various servers that have some of the best steak, chicken, and pork that you'll ever find in one place! I had bacon wrapped filet, top sirloin, tenderloin, and garlic steak. Every single one was so flavorful and tender. What I also love, is that they bring different steak temperatures around and ask you if you'd like that, or let you know that they'll be bringing around one that is your preferred temperature soon. If they only have something in medium rare, for example, you can also request that it be cooked longer. There were some of the meats that we really enjoyed at our table, and when we asked for extra slices or larger portions, our server did not hold back! He was very generous and happy to come back frequently to bring anything we needed. We got so much food, and it was definitely worth the price!

So I came in here because the color way for the Nike Roshe were sold out at all Nike and I knew(well had a feeling) that they would have the colors that I wanted. I walked in and was immediately greeted. Cool whatever, walk over to the Nike wall to check their selections and a young man came up and asked me if I needed a size. I politely said ""no thank you, I'm just looking for right now."" He says ""alright let me know if you need anything"" and walks away. And I swear not even a split second after he walks away, ANOTHER associate asks if I want to try anything on. Again I said ""no thank you, I'm just looking."" HE walks away and then a young lady(again, not even a split second) walks up and asked if I needed any help. And at that point I was so annoyed I needed to get the fuuuuuuuck outta there. So I put the shoe down and a different young man comes up to me and says some crazy like ""oh hey I seen you looking at those. Those are pretty cool right? Yeah they're totally nice. But they look weird on my feet. But I don't think they will on yours. You wanna try them on? Yeah I think you do! What size are you?"" Man I wanted to put my face thru a glass. I said ""easy on the red bull kid. I'm fine, I think I'm done with this store."" As I proceeded to walk out I had 2 more associates ""aw sorry you couldn't find anything, please come back. Have a great day."" Honestly, I appreciated the attentiveness of the staff. But that was just a little too much customer service. In the 1.3 minutes I was there, I felt verbally gang banged. And the other star was for the dope shoes they had in there. And everyone is semi kinda trippin cause the shoes were about the same price as they are in other stores. 40 dollas more?!

The menu includes pre-bottled juices, smoothies, shots, shakes, coffees, acai bowls, salads, and snacks. It's definitely more than just bottled juices. The inside of the shop is clean. The design has bright colors for an inviting feel. There are tables opposite the bar area for those that want to dine in. 

I grabbed two bottled juices to go, Green Valley (#1) and Sweet Greens (#11). The juices were in glass bottles and they came in at $10 a piece. Both were very good, especially for vegetable juices. The Sweet Greens tasted less earthy than most green juices with the pineapple being the dominant flavor. This would be a good juice for someone that wants to sneak vegetables into their diet without tasting them. The Green Valley was more earthy and also delicious. I would order both of them again.

Most of the juice places are serving their juices in glass bottles and I don't love it. I know, I know. If I was more of a tree hugger I would appreciate this, but it's not my preference. The glass bottle can be trickier to drink from. This isn't a knock in stars, just a note.

We both spend a decent amount of time near Walnut Street shopping and going on runs and such, but we have never found a place for a quick bite in the vicinity. I'm sure we'll come back here, but only during off-peak hours since the atmosphere isn't as nice as that of some of our favorite spots.

We walked in and figured that it was seat yourself. I believe there was a sign saying that, but I remember it being turned around so I couldn't really read it. We got a roomy booth and were soon greeted by the waitress for our section. The draft list and BYO burger sheets were on the table, so ordering was pretty self explanatory. We went with soft drinks, since the draft list had no prices anywhere. I feel awkward asking about beer prices, but at the same time I just won't get a draft of something if it's $2 or $3 more than somewhere else where I just had the same thing. Call me crazy, but I'll probably go with the slightly cheaper option in that case. I've been skewered paying $8.50 for a tiny pour at places with no listed prices before, so that's probably just a (very) personal pet peeve of mine. The lack of beer prices on the draft list and the fact that there were TVs at every single booth were my two biggest complaints. It seemed like a sports bar for pretty boy bros, when it really could have been a cozy burger joint tucked away off of Walnut Street.

The food is the reason this pace gets 3 stars from me, since it was reasonably priced for the quantity and everything came out hot and well-assembled. During super busy times this probably isn't the case, but $6 for a 1\/2lb burger (before fries) isn't a bad deal overall. I also liked how their hot BBQ sauce was actually spicy, and I'll definitely be getting all my sandwiches with it in future. My boyfriend loved his burger as well. We'll be back during times when it's sure to be less crowded, like for an early weekend dinner or a lunch, never when there's a game on.",0,0,0,"""Stack'd Burgers - Shadyside""",Shadyside,"""728 Copeland St""",Pittsburgh,PA,15232,40.4510918,-79.9350785,3.5,140,1,Bars;Nightlife;American (Traditional);Burgers;Restaurants;Pubs

My husband ordered lasagna and I ordered the tortellini with vodka sauce which we always order. When they brought out our food they brought my husband ravioli which wasn't what he ordered. My husband at that point decided  to keep the ravioli because we were hungry and wanted to eat together but the server took it away right after he said that. Didn't even give him a chance and she walked away in a hurry with an attitude. So as I'm almost done with my dinner his lasagna came out and my husband couldn't even eat it because it was chewy and tasted as it was heated up in a microwave. Which you should be able to cut right through lasagna if it was fresh. After we said something the server had a worse attitude on her. When we were walking out I decided to ask for a manager because I was actually upset with the way we were treated especially being my favorite restaurant. The owner came up to me and I explained what happened and the owner didn't even want to listen to what I had to say. He said ""well would you believe I've been a chef for 35 years."" That doesn't change the fact the lasagna we asked for wasn't up to par. He didn't even want to hear what I had to say all he had to say was that well this server is requested by others all the time and she wasn't in the wrong. He said that the trainee overheard my husband say ravioli and not lasagna. Well the fact is that's not what we ordered. Apparently the owners behavior isn't anything knew from what I read in the reviews. I've worked in customer service since high school and I work with patients all day long and I would have NEVER handled the way that server\/owner did. I am very disappointed and we won't be back.
